# HPMOR Lore Extraction: Atlantis & Magic Rules

*A reference document for fanfiction set in Atlantis during the creation of the Mirror of Perfect Reflection*

---

## Part 1: The History of Atlantis

### What We Know For Certain

**Atlantis was "erased from Time"** — not merely destroyed, but retroactively removed from existence:

> "Worse than any peril left in these fading years. Not worse than that which erased Atlantis from Time." — Dumbledore (Chapter 61)

> "The Mirror was able to survive when every other effect of Atlantis was undone, all its consequences severed from Time." — Quirrell (Chapter 109)

### Harry's Theory: Atlantis Created the Source of Magic

From Chapter 25, Harry deduces:

- Atlantis was an **isolated civilization** that brought into being the **Source of Magic**
- They programmed it to serve only people with the "Atlantean genetic marker" (the blood of Atlantis)
- Spell incantations like "Wingardium Leviosa" were **literally programmed into the Source** by Atlanteans
- The Source works like a computer: "just like a computer program wouldn't compile if you made a single spelling error, the Source of Magic wouldn't respond to you unless you cast your spells in exactly the right way"

### The Atlantean Mirror Project

From Chapter 109, Quirrell recounts a legend found on metal plates in an ancient place:

> "Some Atlanteans foresaw their world's end, and sought to forge a device of great power to avert the inevitable catastrophe."

**The Device's Intended Powers:**

1. An **absolutely stable existence** (self-sustaining)
2. Could withstand channeling of **unlimited magic**
3. Could **grant wishes**
4. Would somehow **avert the inevitable catastrophes** any sane person would expect from wish-magic

**Social Dynamics in Atlantis:**

- The project was "praised as a noble public endeavour"
- But "nearly all other Atlanteans found more important things to do on any given day than help"
- Even Atlantean nobles ignored it (didn't want someone else obtaining unchallengeable power)
- The creators labored under "pointlessly annoying" working conditions with little support
- **The device was still "far from complete" when Atlantis was destroyed**

### The Catastrophe

The text is deliberately vague about what happened, but we know:

- Something **erased Atlantis from Time itself**
- All consequences of Atlantis were **severed from Time**
- This was worse than "any peril left in these fading years"
- The Mirror alone survived due to its self-reflecting stability

**Creative Opportunity:** The nature of the catastrophe is never specified. Was it an experiment gone wrong? A weapon? An accident with time magic? This is yours to define.

## Part 2: The Mirror of Perfect Reflection

### Physical Properties

- **Golden frame**, simple and unornamented
- **Does not touch the ground** — appears "fixed in place, more solid and more motionless than the walls themselves, like it was nailed to the reference frame of the Earth's motion"
- Reflection is so perfect that "conscious thought was required to deduce that the room inside the frame was only a reflection, rather than a portal"

### Why It Survived

> "This Mirror reflects itself perfectly and therefore its existence is absolutely stable."

The Mirror's self-reference creates ontological stability that allowed it to persist when everything else about Atlantis was undone.

### Known Powers

1. **Creates alternate realms of existence** within itself (limited to what can be seen in the Mirror)
2. **Can store people and objects** in these realms
3. Possesses **"true moral orientation"** — unique among all magics
4. **Phoenixes originated** from a realm evoked inside the Mirror
5. Cannot be personalized — must treat all who come before it by the same rule ("ideal justice")

### The Words of False Comprehension

The Mirror is inscribed with runes in an ancient language that can be **read but not understood**:

> "The runes say, *noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu becafruoy ton wo hsi*—" Harry knew what the rune for noitilov *meant*. It meant noitilov."

This is magical concealment — you can pronounce the words but comprehension is blocked.

### Merlin's Judgment

Merlin used the Mirror as a tool and wrote:

> "Given how painstakingly the Mirror had been crafted to not destroy the world, it would be easier to destroy the world using a lump of cheese."

---

## Part 3: Hard Rules of Magic

### The Source of Magic

- Magic comes from an **external Source**, not from DNA itself
- The Source was **programmed** to respond to specific genetic markers
- Spell incantations must be **exact** — the Source is like a compiler
- DNA acts as an "authentication key" to access the Source

### The Interdict of Merlin

> "There's something called the Interdict of Merlin—which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful spells out of books, even if you find and read a powerful wizard's notes they won't make sense to you, it has to go from one living mind to another."

**Implications:**

- Powerful magic cannot be preserved in books, recordings, or ghosts
- Only **living creatures with good memories** can preserve powerful spells
- This is why Slytherin created a long-lived monster to preserve his secrets
- This is why magical knowledge is steadily being **lost** over centuries

**Note for Atlantis-era stories:** The Interdict did not exist during Atlantis — Merlin came later. Atlantean wizards could freely write down and share powerful spells.

### Transfiguration Laws

1. **Not permanent** — reverts eventually
2. **No liquids or gases** — they evaporate and spread
3. **Nothing to be burned** — smoke could be breathed
4. **No food or consumables** — deadly if ingested
5. **No living subjects** (for free Transfiguration) — body changes during transformation cause permanent damage or death
6. **No currency** — goblins are in "permanent state of war" with counterfeiters
7. **Sustaining costs magic** — constant drain that scales with target size
8. Must re-contact target every few hours

### Time Magic

- Time-Turners cannot go back before they were created
- Stable time loops self-enforce (the universe prevents paradoxes)
- Attempting to extract information via paradox yields "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"

### Dementors

> "They are not undying. They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in the world, and attacking a wound only makes it larger."

They cannot be killed through combat — they are manifestations of Death itself.

### Magical Inheritance

- Follows **single-locus Mendelian inheritance** (not polygenic)
- Two copies: Magic/Magic = Wizard, Magic/NotMagic = Squib, NotMagic/NotMagic = Muggle
- The genetic marker is an "authentication key" to the Source of Magic

---

## Part 4: Soft Rules & Patterns

### Intent and Belief

- Some magic requires **belief** (Platform 9 3/4 won't work if you doubt it)
- Spells require **understanding of intent** — completely wrong information breaks the spell
- But pronunciation must still be **exact** regardless of what you believe

### Pronunciation Precision

- Vowel durations have specific ratios (e.g., "3 to 1 to 2" for certain spells)
- The universe wants you to say spells a certain way and doesn't care how you feel about it

### Magical Exhaustion

- Casting drains magical reserves
- Extended magical effort causes visible fatigue

### Free Transfiguration

- Must be done **wordlessly** (mental only)
- Requires holding "the subject form, the target form, and the transformation within your own mind"

---

## Part 5: Ancient Artifacts & Lost Knowledge

### The Deathly Hallows

- The Cloak of Invisibility produces "perfect absence of image" — true invisibility, not mere concealment
- Created before the Interdict of Merlin
- Considered reality-bending artifacts

### Horcruxes (True Nature)

The common understanding is **wrong**. The truth:

- Don't actually "tear off a piece of soul"
- Channel the death-burst through the caster to create a **ghost** of yourself (not the victim)
- Ghost is imprinted in a device with memories from the moment of creation only
- **No continuity of self** — you keep living and changing, then die, and only the static imprint remains
- Personality mixes with the victim's
- Merlin's Interdict prevents powerful spells from passing through the device

### The Philosopher's Stone

- The "supposed maker was not one who made it"
- The "one who holds it now, was not born to name now used"
- It's a "powerful healing device in truth"
- The common legend is misdirection

### Parseltongue

- **Personal magic**, not a learnable language
- Only Slytherin heirs can use it
- Allows direct magical communication with snakes
- Snake Animagi cannot understand Parseltongue — it's a separate ability

---

## Part 6: Key Figures & Timeline

### Approximate Timeline

1. **Atlantis** — ancient civilization, created Source of Magic
2. **The Catastrophe** — Atlantis erased from Time
3. **Merlin** — came after Atlantis, used the Mirror, created the Interdict
4. **Founders of Hogwarts** (including Salazar Slytherin) — created the Chamber of Secrets
5. **Modern era** — knowledge steadily declining due to Interdict

### Merlin

- Knew about and used the Mirror of Perfect Reflection
- Created the Interdict that prevents knowledge transmission through non-living means
- Left instructions that the Mirror was safe
- Existed after Atlantis fell (he couldn't have used the Mirror otherwise)

## Part 7: Creative Opportunities for Your Fanfic

### What's Explicitly Left Open

1. **The nature of the catastrophe** — what exactly erased Atlantis from Time?
2. **The Source of Magic's creation** — how did they build it? What is it?
3. **The Mirror's incomplete state** — what would a *complete* Mirror have been able to do?
4. **Atlantean society** — only glimpsed (nobles, public projects, indifference)
5. **The foreseers** — who were the Atlanteans who saw the end coming?
6. **Why the project was ignored** — the social/political dynamics
7. **The "pointlessly annoying" working conditions** — Eliezer hints at bureaucratic frustration

### Implied Elements You Could Explore

- The Atlanteans clearly had **advanced magical engineering**
- They could program spell-words into the Source of Magic
- They could create artifacts with **ontological stability**
- They had knowledge that would later be lost to the Interdict
- Some kind of **time magic** was involved (or the catastrophe was temporal in nature)

### Questions Your Story Could Answer

- How did the Atlanteans discover/create the Source of Magic?
- What was life like in a civilization where everyone had magic?
- Who were the creators of the Mirror, and what drove them?
- What was the exact mechanism of the catastrophe?
- How did the Mirror's "moral orientation" get built in?
- Where did phoenixes come from within the Mirror?

## Part 8: Revised Cosmology for the Fanfic

*This section represents our story's interpretation of Atlantis, building on HPMOR canon while filling gaps left by the source material.*

### The Source of Magic: Primordial, Not Atlantean

The Source of Magic always existed—perhaps truly primordial, perhaps created by something so ancient it's beyond memory. It's a fundamental feature of reality, like gravity or time.

Early humans could interact with it, but chaotically, dangerously. Magic without structure is like electricity without circuits—raw, lethal, unpredictable.

**Key insight:** Harry's theory in HPMOR is that Atlantis *created* the Source. But if Atlantis was erased from Time, the Source would have vanished with them. Our interpretation: the Source predates Atlantis. What Atlantis created was the *interface*.

### Atlantis: The Gatekeepers

Atlantis didn't create magic. They **systematized** it.

Their ancestors, eons ago, built:

- **Genetic authentication** — markers in their bloodline that let the Source recognize "authorized users"
- **The spell-word interface** — verbal commands programmed to produce consistent, predictable effects
- **Administrative infrastructure** — a society built around regulating, teaching, and controlling magical access

They live in lofty towers above a dying world. The non-Atlanteans below can't access the Source. They exist in a world where magic is real but denied to them.

**Atlantis isn't a utopia. It's a gated community.**

### The Dying World Below

The world beneath Atlantis's towers is populated by people without the genetic markers—or whose markers are dormant, or corrupted, or simply not recognized by the system. They see Atlantean magic. They benefit from scraps of it. But they cannot wield it themselves.

This creates:
- Resentment and class tension
- An underclass that some Atlanteans exploit, others pity, most ignore
- A moral crisis that thoughtful Atlanteans cannot fully rationalize away

### The Good Intention: Democratization

Someone looks at this system and sees injustice. Why should magic be hoarded by bloodline? Why should billions suffer while Atlanteans live in splendor?

They find a way to give magic to everyone:
- Modifying the genetic marker so it spreads to all humans
- Rewriting the Source's authentication to accept anyone
- Opening the "gates" of the Atlantean system

They think they're liberating humanity. Prometheus bringing fire.

### Why It Goes Wrong

The Atlantean system wasn't just gatekeeping—it was **load-bearing**.

The Source responding to millions of untrained minds, all at once, with no administrative oversight, no safety protocols, no understanding of what they're doing—reality begins to tear. Causality fractures. The spell-word interface, designed for a limited population with shared training, can't handle the contradictory intents of billions.

Or perhaps: the other Atlanteans, seeing their power threatened, react catastrophically. Civil war with reality-warping weapons. The "good intention" triggers a defensive response that escalates beyond control.

### The Erasure: Damage Control

The only way to stop the cascade is to sever Atlantis from Time entirely. Remove the civilization that built the authentication system.

But the genetic markers had already spread. They're in the population now—"outside" the causal chain of Atlantis proper. The Source still recognizes them. The spell-words still work.

**What's lost:**
- The administrative knowledge
- The understanding of *why* spells work
- The safety systems
- The ability to modify or improve the interface

Magic persists, but orphaned. A system without administrators.

### Merlin: The Patch

Generations later, Merlin arises. He's a descendant—he carries the genetic markers—and he's brilliant enough to partially understand what happened.

He sees the chaos: powerful spells cast by people who don't understand them, knowledge spreading through books, letting anyone attempt dangerous magic. The Source is still there, still functional, but it's being abused by people who don't understand the system they're using.

**The Interdict isn't about hoarding power. It's triage.**

Merlin can't rebuild Atlantean administration. But he can limit the damage by ensuring powerful spells can only pass from living mind to living mind. Teachers who understand can pass knowledge to students they've vetted. Books can't spread dangerous spells to everyone indiscriminately.

It's not a solution. It's a bandage on a wound that will never fully heal.

### The HPMOR Theme: Good Intentions

The protagonist isn't destroying Atlantis through selfishness or stupidity. They're destroying it through *justice*. They looked at an unfair system and tried to fix it.

- They were **right** that it was unfair.
- They were **wrong** that they could fix it safely.
- The road to erasing a civilization from Time was paved with good intentions.

## Part 9: Character Concepts

### The Reformer (Protagonist)

An Atlantean who's seen the suffering below. Brilliant, idealistic, convinced they can democratize magic safely. They're *almost* right. Their fatal flaw isn't ignorance—it's confidence. They understand the system better than almost anyone, but "almost" isn't enough when you're rewriting reality.

### The Administrator (Antagonist)

Someone who genuinely believes the system is necessary. Not evil, not selfish—they've seen what happens when unqualified people access the Source. They've cleaned up the accidents. They know the horror stories.

They're the antagonist, but they might be *right*.

### The Outsider

Someone from the dying world below who somehow gained access—illegally? Through the protagonist's early experiments? They provide perspective on what Atlantis looks like from outside. They may be the protagonist's motivation, their proof-of-concept, and ultimately their blind spot.

### The Foreseer

Sees the catastrophe coming but not clearly enough to understand that the *protagonist* causes it. Spends the story trying to prevent the wrong thing. Their warnings are technically accurate but misleading—the classic prophecy trap.

### The Mirror-Builder

Still working on the Mirror of Perfect Reflection. Perhaps they see it as an alternative solution—a way to grant wishes *safely*, to democratize magic *correctly*, if only they had more time. They represent the path not taken.
