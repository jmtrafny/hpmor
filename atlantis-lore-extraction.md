# HPMOR Lore Extraction: Atlantis & Magic Rules

*A reference document for fanfiction set in Atlantis during the creation of the Mirror of Perfect Reflection*

## Part 1: The History of Atlantis

### What We Know For Certain

**Atlantis was "erased from Time"** — not merely destroyed, but retroactively removed from existence:

> "Worse than any peril left in these fading years. Not worse than that which erased Atlantis from Time." — Dumbledore (Chapter 61)

> "The Mirror was able to survive when every other effect of Atlantis was undone, all its consequences severed from Time." — Quirrell (Chapter 109)

### Harry's Theory: Atlantis Created the Source of Magic

From Chapter 25, Harry deduces:

- Atlantis was an **isolated civilization** that brought into being the **Source of Magic**
- They programmed it to serve only people with the "Atlantean genetic marker" (the blood of Atlantis)
- Spell incantations like "Wingardium Leviosa" were **literally programmed into the Source** by Atlanteans
- The Source works like a computer: "just like a computer program wouldn't compile if you made a single spelling error, the Source of Magic wouldn't respond to you unless you cast your spells in exactly the right way"

### The Atlantean Mirror Project

From Chapter 109, Quirrell recounts a legend found on metal plates in an ancient place:

> "Some Atlanteans foresaw their world's end, and sought to forge a device of great power to avert the inevitable catastrophe."

**The Device's Intended Powers:**

1. An **absolutely stable existence** (self-sustaining)
2. Could withstand channeling of **unlimited magic**
3. Could **grant wishes**
4. Would somehow **avert the inevitable catastrophes** any sane person would expect from wish-magic

**Social Dynamics in Atlantis:**

- The project was "praised as a noble public endeavour"
- But "nearly all other Atlanteans found more important things to do on any given day than help"
- Even Atlantean nobles ignored it (didn't want someone else obtaining unchallengeable power)
- The creators labored under "pointlessly annoying" working conditions with little support
- **The device was still "far from complete" when Atlantis was destroyed**

### The Catastrophe

The text is deliberately vague about what happened, but we know:

- Something **erased Atlantis from Time itself**
- All consequences of Atlantis were **severed from Time**
- This was worse than "any peril left in these fading years"
- The Mirror alone survived due to its self-reflecting stability

**Creative Opportunity:** The nature of the catastrophe is never specified. Was it an experiment gone wrong? A weapon? An accident with time magic? This is yours to define.

## Part 2: The Mirror of Perfect Reflection

### Physical Properties

- **Golden frame**, simple and unornamented
- **Does not touch the ground** — appears "fixed in place, more solid and more motionless than the walls themselves, like it was nailed to the reference frame of the Earth's motion"
- Reflection is so perfect that "conscious thought was required to deduce that the room inside the frame was only a reflection, rather than a portal"

### Why It Survived

> "This Mirror reflects itself perfectly and therefore its existence is absolutely stable."

The Mirror's self-reference creates ontological stability that allowed it to persist when everything else about Atlantis was undone.

### Known Powers

1. **Creates alternate realms of existence** within itself (limited to what can be seen in the Mirror)
2. **Can store people and objects** in these realms
3. Possesses **"true moral orientation"** — unique among all magics
4. **Phoenixes originated** from a realm evoked inside the Mirror
5. Cannot be personalized — must treat all who come before it by the same rule ("ideal justice")

### The Words of False Comprehension

The Mirror is inscribed with runes in an ancient language that can be **read but not understood**:

> "The runes say, *noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu becafruoy ton wo hsi*—" Harry knew what the rune for noitilov *meant*. It meant noitilov."

This is magical concealment — you can pronounce the words but comprehension is blocked.

### Merlin's Judgment

Merlin used the Mirror as a tool and wrote:

> "Given how painstakingly the Mirror had been crafted to not destroy the world, it would be easier to destroy the world using a lump of cheese."

## Part 3: Hard Rules of Magic

### The Source of Magic

- Magic comes from an **external Source**, not from DNA itself
- The Source was **programmed** to respond to specific genetic markers
- Spell incantations must be **exact** — the Source is like a compiler
- DNA acts as an "authentication key" to access the Source

### The Interdict of Merlin

> "There's something called the Interdict of Merlin—which stops anyone from getting knowledge of powerful spells out of books, even if you find and read a powerful wizard's notes they won't make sense to you, it has to go from one living mind to another."

**Implications:**

- Powerful magic cannot be preserved in books, recordings, or ghosts
- Only **living creatures with good memories** can preserve powerful spells
- This is why Slytherin created a long-lived monster to preserve his secrets
- This is why magical knowledge is steadily being **lost** over centuries

**Note for Atlantis-era stories:** The Interdict did not exist during Atlantis — Merlin came later. Atlantean wizards could freely write down and share powerful spells.

### Transfiguration Laws

1. **Not permanent** — reverts eventually
2. **No liquids or gases** — they evaporate and spread
3. **Nothing to be burned** — smoke could be breathed
4. **No food or consumables** — deadly if ingested
5. **No living subjects** (for free Transfiguration) — body changes during transformation cause permanent damage or death
6. **No currency** — goblins are in "permanent state of war" with counterfeiters
7. **Sustaining costs magic** — constant drain that scales with target size
8. Must re-contact target every few hours

### Time Magic

- Time-Turners cannot go back before they were created
- Stable time loops self-enforce (the universe prevents paradoxes)
- Attempting to extract information via paradox yields "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME"

### Dementors

> "They are not undying. They do not possess eternal life. They are wounds in the world, and attacking a wound only makes it larger."

They cannot be killed through combat — they are manifestations of Death itself.

### Magical Inheritance

- Follows **single-locus Mendelian inheritance** (not polygenic)
- Two copies: Magic/Magic = Wizard, Magic/NotMagic = Squib, NotMagic/NotMagic = Muggle
- The genetic marker is an "authentication key" to the Source of Magic

---

## Part 4: Soft Rules & Patterns

### Intent and Belief

- Some magic requires **belief** (Platform 9 3/4 won't work if you doubt it)
- Spells require **understanding of intent** — completely wrong information breaks the spell
- But pronunciation must still be **exact** regardless of what you believe

### Pronunciation Precision

- Vowel durations have specific ratios (e.g., "3 to 1 to 2" for certain spells)
- The universe wants you to say spells a certain way and doesn't care how you feel about it

### Magical Exhaustion

- Casting drains magical reserves
- Extended magical effort causes visible fatigue

### Free Transfiguration

- Must be done **wordlessly** (mental only)
- Requires holding "the subject form, the target form, and the transformation within your own mind"

---

## Part 5: Ancient Artifacts & Lost Knowledge

### The Deathly Hallows

- The Cloak of Invisibility produces "perfect absence of image" — true invisibility, not mere concealment
- Created before the Interdict of Merlin
- Considered reality-bending artifacts

### Horcruxes (True Nature)

The common understanding is **wrong**. The truth:

- Don't actually "tear off a piece of soul"
- Channel the death-burst through the caster to create a **ghost** of yourself (not the victim)
- Ghost is imprinted in a device with memories from the moment of creation only
- **No continuity of self** — you keep living and changing, then die, and only the static imprint remains
- Personality mixes with the victim's
- Merlin's Interdict prevents powerful spells from passing through the device

### The Philosopher's Stone

- The "supposed maker was not one who made it"
- The "one who holds it now, was not born to name now used"
- It's a "powerful healing device in truth"
- The common legend is misdirection

### Parseltongue

- **Personal magic**, not a learnable language
- Only Slytherin heirs can use it
- Allows direct magical communication with snakes
- Snake Animagi cannot understand Parseltongue — it's a separate ability

---

## Part 6: Key Figures & Timeline

### Approximate Timeline

1. **Atlantis** — ancient civilization, created Source of Magic
2. **The Catastrophe** — Atlantis erased from Time
3. **Merlin** — came after Atlantis, used the Mirror, created the Interdict
4. **Founders of Hogwarts** (including Salazar Slytherin) — created the Chamber of Secrets
5. **Modern era** — knowledge steadily declining due to Interdict

### Merlin

- Knew about and used the Mirror of Perfect Reflection
- Created the Interdict that prevents knowledge transmission through non-living means
- Left instructions that the Mirror was safe
- Existed after Atlantis fell (he couldn't have used the Mirror otherwise)

## Part 7: Creative Opportunities for Your Fanfic

### What's Explicitly Left Open

1. **The nature of the catastrophe** — what exactly erased Atlantis from Time?
2. **The Source of Magic's creation** — how did they build it? What is it?
3. **The Mirror's incomplete state** — what would a *complete* Mirror have been able to do?
4. **Atlantean society** — only glimpsed (nobles, public projects, indifference)
5. **The foreseers** — who were the Atlanteans who saw the end coming?
6. **Why the project was ignored** — the social/political dynamics
7. **The "pointlessly annoying" working conditions** — Eliezer hints at bureaucratic frustration

### Implied Elements You Could Explore

- The Atlanteans clearly had **advanced magical engineering**
- They could program spell-words into the Source of Magic
- They could create artifacts with **ontological stability**
- They had knowledge that would later be lost to the Interdict
- Some kind of **time magic** was involved (or the catastrophe was temporal in nature)

### Questions Your Story Could Answer

- How did the Atlanteans discover/create the Source of Magic?
- What was life like in a civilization where everyone had magic?
- Who were the creators of the Mirror, and what drove them?
- What was the exact mechanism of the catastrophe?
- How did the Mirror's "moral orientation" get built in?
- Where did phoenixes come from within the Mirror?
