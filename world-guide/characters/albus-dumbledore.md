# Albus Dumbledore

## Basic Information

- **House**: Gryffindor (as student)

## HPMOR vs Canon Divergences

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES:**

1. **Competent But Not Omniscient**: Genuinely smart and powerful but makes real mistakes. Canon Dumbledore sometimes seemed to know everything.

2. **Tragic Figure**: Haunted by Grindelwald, sister's death, prophecy manipulation. More explicitly burdened.

3. **Manipulative For Good**: Consciously manipulates but believes it's necessary. More morally grey.

4. **Accepts Death**: Philosophical opposition to Harry's rejection of death as natural. Sees death as "next great adventure."

5. **Fawkes Chooses Harry**: Phoenix eventually leaves Dumbledore for Harry - symbolic rejection of his path.

6. **Makes Mistakes**: Traps Harry at Hogwarts, makes wrong call on Hermione, other errors shown.

7. **Relationship with Harry**: More adversarial. Harry sees him as obstacle, manipulator.

## Personality & Motivations

### Core Traits [EXPLICIT]

- **"Twinkling" persona**: Uses grandfatherly image as tool. "Twinkled" at students. Conscious performance. [Throughout]

- **Burdened by past**: Grindelwald relationship, sister Ariana's death, many mistakes haunt him. [Ch. 39, 77]

- **Cautious to fault**: "I am too cautious to be a hero." Paralyzed by fear of repeating past mistakes. [IMPLIED]

- **Powerful**: One of most powerful wizards alive. True skill shown rarely. [Throughout]

- **Loves Harry (in his way)**: Genuine affection but subordinates it to "greater good." [Throughout]

### Voice & Speech Patterns

**Vocabulary**: Whimsical, elliptical, uses Shakespeare quotes, speaks in riddles

**Common Patterns**:
- "Twinkling" (eyes described as twinkling constantly)
- Offers candy/lemon drops
- Speaks in parables and indirect statements
- Shakespeare references
- "Ah" and "I see" (thoughtful sounds)

**Emotional Range**:
- Default: Grandfatherly, whimsical
- Serious: Drops performance, shows age and sorrow
- Powerful: Rare but overwhelming

### Dialogue Samples

**Whimsical Persona:**
> [Offers lemon drops, twinkles eyes] [Common]

**On Death:**
> "To the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure." [Ch. 39]

## Writer Notes

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too powerful**: He's strong but not omniscient, makes real errors
2. **Too evil**: He means well, methods are questionable not motives
3. **Canon omniscient Dumbledore**: This one has limits, makes mistakes
4. **Missing the performance**: "Twinkling" is deliberate tool

### Key Nuances

- Paralyzed by fear of making wrong choice (learned from Grindelwald)
- Loves Harry but subordinates it to perceived duty
- Accepts death philosophically (opposes Harry's rejection of death)
- Performance vs. reality: twinkling is mask, underneath is sorrow and burden

### Writing Successfully

- Elliptical speech pattern
- Layer of whimsy over deep sorrow
- Uses literary references
- Shows rather than states power
- Manipulative but not malicious
