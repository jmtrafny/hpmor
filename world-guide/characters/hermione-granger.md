# Hermione Granger

## Basic Information

- **Full Name**: Hermione Jean Granger
- **House**: Ravenclaw
- **Role**: Harry's best friend; General Sunshine; S.P.H.E.W. founder; ultimate moral anchor
- **First Appearance**: Ch. 9
- **Chapter Count**: Appears in approximately 70 chapters (heavy in early chapters, 64-90, 120-122)

## HPMOR vs Canon Divergences

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM CANON HERMIONE:**

1. **House**: Ravenclaw, not Gryffindor. More intellectual focus, surrounded by fellow scholars.

2. **Proactive Leadership**: Founds S.P.H.E.W. (Society for the Promotion of Heroic Equality for Witches), leads army as General Sunshine. Canon Hermione was more supportive than leading.

3. **Relationship with Harry**: Best friends/intellectual equals with romantic undertones. Both recognize the other's brilliance. Canon trio dynamic absent.

4. **Social Awareness**: Better social skills and emotional intelligence than HPMOR Harry. Can navigate complex situations.

5. **Tragic Arc**: Dies in Ch. 89 (troll attack), resurrected in Ch. 122. Transforms into "something like a unicorn" - innocence personified.

6. **General Role**: Leads army in battle, commands respect, not just "brightest witch." More heroic, proactive.

7. **Death and Resurrection**: Central tragedy of story. Her death drives Harry's character development and quest against death itself.

## Writer Notes

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Making her just "smart girl"**: She's a leader, general, hero in her own right
2. **Forgetting moral core**: Her goodness is fundamental, not performance
3. **Missing emotional intelligence**: She understands people better than Harry
4. **Canon personality**: This is Ravenclaw Hermione, more proactive and heroic

### Key Nuances

1. **Death and resurrection change her**: Post-Ch. 122 Hermione has died, remembers it
2. **Unicorn-like properties**: Innocence made manifest, protected by Hogwarts wards
3. **Would sacrifice self for others**: Core character trait, led to death
4. **Harry's emotional anchor**: She keeps him human, connected to goodness

### Writing This Character Successfully

- Earnest voice without irony
- Moral clarity without self-righteousness
- Intelligence shown through action
- Heroism through sacrifice, not violence
- Balance of strength and vulnerability
