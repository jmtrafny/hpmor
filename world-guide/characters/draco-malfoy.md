## HPMOR vs Canon Divergences

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM CANON DRACO:**

1. **Capable of Growth**: Can change beliefs through rational argument and evidence. Canon Draco remained largely static.

2. **Intellectually Curious**: Genuinely interested in learning scientific method from Harry. Becomes capable scientist.

3. **Complex Morality**: Not simply evil or prejudiced. Product of upbringing, capable of questioning it.

4. **Friendship with Harry**: Real friendship formed through mutual respect, not pure antagonism.

5. **Scientist Potential**: "You could have been a scientist" - Harry sees genuine intellectual ability.

6. **Redemption**: Transforms from blood purist to someone questioning entire worldview.

7. **Relationship with Father**: More complex. Loves Lucius but increasingly questions his values.

## Personality & Motivations

### Core Traits [EXPLICIT]

- **Noble bearing**: Raised as heir to great House. "I am Draco, son of Lucius, of House Malfoy." Aristocratic in manner. [Ch. 7-8]

- **Initially blood purist**: Believes in pure-blood supremacy (taught by father). "Mudblood" language early on. [Ch. 7-8]

- **Proud but not stupid**: Takes pride seriously but willing to learn. "House Malfoy does not teach foolishness." [Ch. 7]

- **Loyal**: To House, father, eventually to friends (Harry). Takes oaths seriously. [Throughout]

- **Capable student**: Learns quickly, applies lessons. General of army, competent leader. [Ch. 22-35]

### Values & Goals [STRONGLY IMPLIED]

- **House Honor**: Malfoy reputation and power matters deeply. Must not shame family. [Throughout]

- **Proving worth**: Needs to be worthy heir, successful in own right. [Throughout]

- **Understanding truth**: Once Harry introduces experimental method, genuinely wants to know truth. [Ch. 8+]

- **Power and respect**: Wants to be powerful, respected, feared when necessary. Slytherin values. [Throughout]

### Character Arc

**Early (Ch 5-30)**: Pure-blood supremacist learning scientific method from Harry. Begins questioning assumptions.

**Middle (Ch 31-80)**: Friendship deepens. Leads army. Attempted murder (false accusation) forces crisis.

**Late (Ch 81-122)**: Transformation. Learns truth about Death Eaters. Questions everything. Becomes ally.

### Voice & Speech Patterns

**Vocabulary**: Aristocratic, formal, uses "House Malfoy" frequently

**Common Phrases**:
- "I am Draco, son of Lucius, of House Malfoy"
- "House Malfoy does not..."
- "Father says..." (early); less frequent later
- Formal address: "Mr. Potter" before friendship deepens

**Evolution**: Becomes less formal with Harry, less certain of blood purity, more questioning.

### Dialogue Samples

**Early Aristocratic:**
> "I am Draco, son of Lucius, of House Malfoy, heir to the Malfoy fortune and the high seat of the ancient House of Malfoy, and \emph{Potter} does not scare me." [Ch. 7]

**Learning Science:**
> [Accepts experimental method for testing blood purity claims] [Ch. 8]

**Transformation:**
> [Learns truth about Death Eaters, Voldemort; world view shattered] [Ch. 120]

## Writer Notes

### Common Mistakes

1. **Making him canon Draco**: This Draco can grow, think, change
2. **Too quick redemption**: Transformation is gradual, painful, hard-won
3. **Losing aristocratic bearing**: Even when changing, maintains noble manner
4. **Forgetting his intelligence**: He's genuinely smart, not just privileged

### Key Nuances

- Loves father but outgrowing father's values
- Friendship with Harry is real but complicated
- Pride is both flaw and strength
- Scientific thinking appeals to his desire for truth and power

### Writing Successfully

- Formal voice even in friendship
- Gradual evolution of beliefs
- Struggle between loyalty and truth
- Maintains dignity even in crisis
