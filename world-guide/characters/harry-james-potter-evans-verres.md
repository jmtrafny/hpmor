# Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres

## Basic Information

- **Full Name**: Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres
- **House**: Ravenclaw
- **Role**: Protagonist; The Boy-Who-Lived; student rationalist; would-be scientific revolutionary
- **First Appearance**: Ch. 1
- **Chapter Count**: Appears in approximately 120 chapters (nearly all chapters)

## HPMOR vs Canon Divergences

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM CANON HARRY POTTER:**

1. **Upbringing**: Raised by scientist stepfather Michael Verres-Evans and transfigured Petunia (beautiful, not bitter) in loving, intellectual Oxford household filled with books. Contrast to canon's abused child in cupboard under stairs.

2. **Education**: Tutored in science, rationality, and critical thinking from age 5. Has read Feynman Lectures on Physics, understands Bayesian reasoning, familiar with cognitive biases and experimental method. Canon Harry had minimal education.

3. **Personality Core**: Rationalist first, hero second. Approaches magic as scientific phenomenon to be understood and exploited. Canon Harry was instinctive and emotional.

4. **Ambition**: Wants to revolutionize magical world, defeat death itself, optimize everything. Canon Harry just wanted normal life and to stop Voldemort.

5. **Relationships**: Forms intellectual alliance with Draco and Hermione simultaneously (trying to reform Draco). Canon Harry hated Draco from first meeting.

6. **Moral Framework**: Utilitarian with strong protection instinct. Struggles with "dark side" (cold ruthlessness). Canon Harry was straightforwardly good.

7. **Magical Ability**: Discovers partial Transfiguration through understanding physics. Creates true Patronus (human-shaped, can destroy Dementors) by rejecting death as the enemy. Canon Harry's Patronus was animal-shaped.

## Personality & Motivations

### Core Traits [EXPLICIT]

- **Rationalist mindset**: "The first virtue is curiosity." Constantly asks "How do I know what I know?" and "What do I think I know, and how do I think I know it?" [Ch. 1, throughout]

- **Scientific thinking**: Applies experimental method to magic. When told magic exists: "If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves... That's what the experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve things just by arguing." [Ch. 1]

- **Intense protectiveness**: "I won't let anyone bully my friends. Not you. Not anyone." Willing to sacrifice everything for those he cares about (spends entire Potter fortune to save Hermione from Azkaban) [Ch. 18, 82-84]

- **Ambitious reformer**: Doesn't just want to learn magic—wants to revolutionize wizarding world, defeat death, bring scientific method to magical society [Ch. 1-6, throughout]

- **Pattern recognition**: Extremely quick to see connections, solve puzzles, deduce hidden information. Sometimes too quick (jumps to conclusions) [Throughout]

### Values & Goals [STRONGLY IMPLIED]

- **Death is the enemy**: Central motivation post-Dementor encounter. "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." Accepts family quest to defeat death itself [Ch. 45, 96]

- **Optimization**: Compulsively tries to find better solutions to everything. Wants to eliminate Snitch from Quidditch, reform Azkaban, fix broken systems [Ch. 35, 60]

- **Knowledge/understanding over belief**: "Don't believe everything you think." Constantly updates beliefs based on evidence [Ch. 1, throughout]

- **Protecting the innocent**: Especially children and those who can't protect themselves. Profoundly disturbed by Azkaban and Dementors used as punishment [Ch. 60-63]

- **Friendship and connection**: Despite rationalist exterior, deeply values relationships with Hermione, Draco, Quirrell. "If I were the first person in the universe who ever really cared about someone else, which I'm not by the way, then I'd be honoured to be that person." [Ch. 95]

### Blind Spots & Flaws [INFERRED]

- **Overconfidence**: Frequently certain he's figured things out when he hasn't. "Clever-lad syndrome"—too smart for his own good [Throughout]

- **Difficulty accepting limits**: When told Dementors can't be killed: "Really? What did they try?" Always looking for the loophole [Ch. 45]

- **Emotional compartmentalization**: Splits into "light side" and "dark side," struggles to integrate emotions with rationality. Dark side is cold, ruthless, focused purely on winning [Ch. 44-45, 89]

- **Hero complex**: Despite utilitarian framework, often takes too much responsibility. "Someone has to do something, and why not me?" [Throughout]

- **Doesn't understand people who don't think like him**: Frustrated by those who won't listen to logical arguments or update beliefs based on evidence [Ch. 1, throughout]

- **Arrogance**: Knows he's smarter than most adults around him, struggles with proper deference. Gets him in trouble with authorities [Ch. 18, others]

### Hidden Depths [STRONGLY IMPLIED]

- **Deep capacity for love**: Despite rationalist focus, loves parents, Hermione, even Draco. This love drives many major decisions [Ch. 7, 36, 82-84, 89-96]

- **Trauma and darkness**: Dark side emerged from something traumatic. Capable of ruthless killing when those he loves are threatened (kills troll with cold efficiency) [Ch. 89]

- **Humility underneath**: Knows he makes mistakes. "I'm going to make some embarrassing mistakes, but that happens when you're doing something new and difficult that nobody's ever done before." [Ch. 1]

- **Loneliness**: Despite intelligence, often feels isolated. Craves intellectual equals (finds them in Hermione, Draco, Quirrell) [Implied throughout]

## Key Relationships

### With Hermione Granger

**Nature**: Best friend, intellectual equal, person he loves most (romantic undertones but not explicitly romantic). Hermione represents Harry's connection to goodness and heroism.

**Evolution**: Recognition as kindred spirit (Ch. 9) → friendship and academic rivalry → Harry defending her brilliance (Ch. 36) → her saving him from Dementor with kiss (Ch. 44) → buying her from Azkaban (Ch. 82-84) → her death and his refusal to accept it (Ch. 89-90) → eventual resurrection and sworn friendship (Ch. 122)

**Key scenes**:
- Ch. 9: First meeting on train
- Ch. 36: "Your daughter is the most talented witch of her generation and the brightest star of Hogwarts!"
- Ch. 44: Hermione kisses Harry to bring him back from dark side
- Ch. 82-84: Trial scene; Harry offers everything to save her
- Ch. 89: "Not your fault" (her last words)
- Ch. 122: Friendship oath

**Dynamic**: Hermione keeps Harry grounded, morally anchored. He respects her completely, trusts her judgment, values her above wealth or safety.

### With Draco Malfoy

**Nature**: Unlikely friendship formed through rational discourse. Harry's attempt to reform pure-blood supremacist through Socratic method and scientific education.

**Evolution**: First meeting with Socratic questioning (Ch. 7-8) → teaching experimental method (Ch. 8) → army battles as rival generals → genuine friendship → Draco questioning blood purity → Draco's transformation after learning truth about Death Eaters

**Key scenes**:
- Ch. 7-8: Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, Hogwarts Express conversations
- Ch. 23-27: Army battles, increasing respect
- Ch. 41: Wall-climbing incident; Draco must choose whether to drop Hermione
- Ch. 97-98: Draco deduces Dumbledore's guilt

**Dynamic**: Teacher-student at first, then genuine equals. Harry believes Draco can be better than his upbringing. Draco represents Harry's hope that people can change through reason.

### With Professor Quirrell (David Monroe/Voldemort)

**Nature**: Mentor-student relationship with dark undertones. Most intellectually stimulating relationship Harry has with adult. Eventually revealed as Lord Voldemort.

**Evolution**: Brilliant Defense Professor (Ch. 16) → inspiring mentor teaching battle magic → father figure offering guidance → partner in Azkaban breakout (Ch. 53-60) → warning as David Monroe about resurrection dangers (Ch. 95) → [final confrontation in Ch. 100+]

**Key scenes**:

### With Albus Dumbledore

**Nature**: Wary adversarial respect. Harry sees Dumbledore as manipulative "for the greater good" while Dumbledore sees Harry as dangerous potential Dark Lord who must be contained.

**Evolution**: Initial respect (Ch. 1-17) → confrontation over Snape (Ch. 18) → deducing Dumbledore's role in parents' deaths (Ch. 46) → house arrest (Ch. 62) → Fawkes choosing Harry (Ch. 62-63) → eventual alliance against common enemy

**Key scenes**:

- Ch. 39: Debate about death and afterlife
- Ch. 46: Harry deduces prophecy manipulation
- Ch. 62: Fawkes chooses Harry
- Ch. 77: Memorial room and "phoenix's price"

**Dynamic**: Two people who both want to do good but have incompatible methods. Dumbledore fears Harry's potential for destruction. Harry resents Dumbledore's manipulations and acceptance of unjust systems.

### With Petunia and Michael Verres-Evans

**Nature**: Loving parental relationships. Petunia is protective but distant (scarred by sister's death). Michael is rational, academic, supportive but doesn't take Harry fully seriously.

**Evolution**: Supportive childhood (pre-Ch. 1) → strain over magic (Ch. 1-6) → continued love despite distance (Ch. 7, 91)

**Key scenes**:
- Ch. 1: Family argument over magic's reality
- Ch. 7: Emotional goodbye at Platform 9¾
- Ch. 91: Harry explains "dark side" to parents

## Voice & Speech Patterns

### Vocabulary & Complexity

- **Vocabulary Level**: Highly sophisticated for 11-year-old. Academic, technical, scientific. Uses words like "empiricism," "Bayesian," "utilitarian," "falsification."
- **Sentence Structure**: Variable. Can be short and direct under stress. Often complex, nested, analytical when explaining. Stream-of-consciousness internal monologue with multiple clauses.
- **Formality**: Varies by context. Formal/technical when discussing science or magic. More casual with peers. Respectful but not deferential to adults.

### Characteristic Patterns

- **Common Phrases/Verbal Tics**:
  - "What do I think I know, and how do I think I know it?" (frequent internal refrain)
  - "Obvious in retrospect" or "should have been obvious" (often)
  - References to Bayesian reasoning, priors, posterior probability (moderate frequency)
  - "The first virtue is curiosity" and other "virtues" (occasional)
  - Scientific/literary references: Feynman, Ender's Game, Asimov, etc. (frequent)
  - "Oh, come on!" or "Seriously?" (when frustrated with illogic)

- **What They Reference**:
  - **Science**: Physics (especially quantum mechanics), chemistry, biology, experimental method
  - **Literature**: Science fiction (Ender's Game, Foundation series), Feynman's lectures
  - **Rationality**: Cognitive biases, Bayesian reasoning, decision theory
  - **Pop culture**: Occasional references to movies, books from Muggle world

- **Emotional Range in Voice**:
  - **Calm/analytical**: Precise, technical, multi-clause sentences
  - **Excited/discovering**: Faster pace, exclamations, questions
  - **Angry**: Short, clipped, sometimes goes cold rather than hot
  - **Protective/desperate**: Simpler vocabulary, more emotional, direct
  - **Dark side**: Extremely cold, clinical, no wasted words, purely instrumental

- **Unique Quirks**:
  - Internal running commentary on his own thoughts
  - Frequently references Muggle science in magical contexts
  - Uses probability language ("ninety percent confident," "low prior")
  - Corrects himself mid-sentence when being more precise
  - Sometimes talks to his own brain as separate entity

### Dialogue Samples

**Calm/Normal (Analytical Mode):**
> "Mum, if you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There's a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation—that you just have to look at the world and report what you see." [Ch. 1]

**Explaining Scientific Method:**
> "The way to show someone else is to perform an experiment where the result comes out one way if I'm right, and another way if you're right." [Ch. 8, to Draco]

**Excited Discovery:**
> "Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?" [Ch. 1, testing hypothesis despite embarrassment]

**Angry/Confrontational:**
> "I won't let anyone bully my friends. Not you. Not anyone." [Ch. 18, to Dumbledore about Snape]

**Protective/Desperate:**
> "Bring her back." [Ch. 89, to Dumbledore after Hermione's death]
> "She's not dead. She's just not alive right now." [Ch. 90]

**Defending Hermione (Passionate):**
> "Your daughter is the most talented witch of her generation and the brightest star of Hogwarts, and some day, Mr and Mrs Granger, the fact that you were her parents will be the only reason that history remembers you!" [Ch. 36]

**Dark Side (Cold, Instrumental):**
> [Internal, during troll fight: "intent to kill / think purely of killing / grasp at any means to do so / censors off, do not flinch / KILL"] [Ch. 89]
> (Note: When in dark side, Harry doesn't speak much—he acts with cold efficiency)

**Philosophical/Deep:**
> "There is light in the world, and it is us!" [Ch. 45, creating true Patronus]

**With Quirrell (Respectful, Intellectual):**
> "Suppose you threw it into the Sun? Would it be destroyed?" [Ch. 45, about Dementors]

**Humorous/Self-Aware:**
> "I have no logical way of knowing that for certain. My parents raised me to believe that my name was Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, and many people here have told me that I look like my parents, I mean my other parents, but for all I know, there could easily be spells to polymorph a child into a specified appearance—" [Ch. 7, to Ron asking if he's Harry Potter]

**Internal Monologue (Characteristic):**
> "Don't believe everything you think, one of his books had said. But this bizarre certainty... Harry was finding himself just expecting that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up and wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was making no effort to guard itself against falsification—wasn't making excuses in advance for why there wouldn't be a professor, or the professor would only be able to bend spoons. Where do you come from, strange little prediction? Harry directed the thought at his brain. Why do I believe what I believe?" [Ch. 1]

## Writer Notes

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Making him purely logical**: Harry has strong emotions, makes mistakes driven by feeling. He loves deeply, gets angry, feels grief. The rational framework is how he processes, not who he is.

2. **Forgetting his age**: He's 11-12 years old. Brilliant but still a child. Has tantrums, gets embarrassed, doesn't always think through consequences.

3. **Over-explaining everything**: Harry doesn't always articulate his reasoning out loud. Much of his analysis is internal. In dialogue, he can be concise.

4. **Ignoring character growth**: Harry changes significantly across story. Early Harry is more arrogant, less emotionally integrated. Later Harry has been through trauma and loss.

5. **Making dark side too frequent**: Dark side appears only under specific triggers (protecting loved ones, extreme danger). It's not his default state.

6. **Forgetting his humor**: Harry has dry wit, makes jokes, sees absurdity in situations. He's not a robot.

### Key Nuances

1. **Light vs. Dark integration**: Major arc is integrating rational/"dark" side with emotional/"light" side. Neither is bad—both are necessary.

2. **Respect for intelligence**: Harry respects competence and intelligence wherever he finds it (Quirrell, Hermione, Draco, Dumbledore) even in enemies.

3. **Protection instinct**: Underneath rationalist exterior is fierce protectiveness. Would sacrifice anything for those he loves.

4. **Death as central theme**: Post-Dementor, rejection of death becomes core motivation. Not just Hermione's death—death itself as the enemy.

5. **Humility within arrogance**: Knows he's smart but also knows he makes mistakes. "I'm going to make some embarrassing mistakes."

6. **References matter**: Science fiction (especially Ender's Game), Feynman, rationality concepts aren't just decoration—they're how Harry thinks.

### Character Evolution to Respect

- **Early Harry (Ch. 1-30)**: Confident, somewhat arrogant, believes rationality solves everything
- **Middle Harry (Ch. 31-90)**: Learning limits of pure reason, confronting moral complexity, integrating emotions
- **Late Harry (Ch. 91-122)**: Synthesis of reason and emotion, acceptance of responsibility, willingness to sacrifice

**Post-canon Harry should:**
- Still use scientific method but with more humility
- Have integrated light and dark sides more successfully
- Be haunted by Hermione's death even after resurrection
- Take his role as revolutionary seriously but not arrogantly
- Reference his mistakes and learning experiences
- Show deeper emotional connection while maintaining analytical framework

### Writing This Character Successfully

1. **Internal monologue is key**: Much of Harry's character comes through his thought process. Show the analysis happening.

2. **Use scientific/rationality references naturally**: Should feel like how he thinks, not forced exposition. "Ninety percent confident" instead of "pretty sure."

3. **Balance emotion and logic**: Best Harry moments combine both. "There is light in the world, and it is us!" is emotional AND rational.

4. **Show, don't tell, his intelligence**: Have him solve problems, make connections, rather than saying "Harry was smart."

5. **Remember his relationships**: Harry alone is less interesting than Harry interacting with Hermione, Draco, Quirrell, etc.

6. **Physical descriptions matter**: He's small for his age, has messy hair, green eyes, lightning scar. Often described as looking fragile or vulnerable.

7. **Voice consistency**:
   - Questions and analysis in normal speech
   - Technical precision when explaining
   - Emotional directness when protecting others
   - Cold efficiency in dark side
   - Humor through absurdity observation

8. **His mistakes are part of his character**: Don't make him right all the time. He jumps to conclusions, overestimates himself, misses social cues.
