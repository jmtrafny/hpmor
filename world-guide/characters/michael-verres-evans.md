## Personality & Motivations

### Core Traits [EXPLICIT]

- **Loving father**: Genuinely cares for Harry. "Do you think I bought you enough books?" [Ch. 7]

- **Doesn't take Harry fully seriously**: "Good Parent" but doesn't treat 11-year-old as intellectual equal. [Ch. 1]

- **Cannot perceive magic well**: Difficulty looking at Harry's trunk, can't walk through Platform 9¾. [Ch. 7]

- **Intellectually honest**: Scientist, believes in evidence, but applies limits to son. [Throughout]

- **Good provider**: Spends fortune on books, education, opportunities for Harry. [Ch. 7]

- Loving: Shows through actions more than words

### Dialogue Samples

**Skeptical About Magic:**
> "Dear, I understand that you're not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible." [Ch. 1]

**Loving Father:**
> "Do you think I bought you enough books?" [Wanting specific answer] [Ch. 7]

**Teaching Harry:**
> [References to proper experimental method, Feynman, scientific thinking] [Ch. 1, flashbacks]

## Writer Notes

### Common Mistakes

1. **Making him bad father**: He's loving, supportive, invested
2. **Too much respect for Harry**: Doesn't quite take him as equal despite intelligence
3. **Forgetting academic profession**: He's Oxford professor, speaks/acts accordingly
4. **Missing magic limitation**: Can't perceive/interact with magic easily

### Key Nuances

- Taught Harry rationality but doesn't follow through to respecting Harry's conclusions
- Loving in his way - actions (buying books) more than words
- Cannot fully enter Harry's magical world (physical limitation)
- "Good Parent" role vs. actually listening to child
- Took wife's name - significant status flip

### Writing Successfully

- Academic voice, professorial
- Show love through actions (providing books, education)
- Respectful distance from magic
- Parental but not patronizing exactly - just limited
- Scientific language naturally integrated
