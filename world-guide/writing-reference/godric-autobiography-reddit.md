# [Fan Content] What Godric Gryffindor's 30-Inch Autobiography Might Have Said

In Chapter 70, Hermione discovers that Godric Gryffindor left behind an autobiography—just thirty inches of scroll, "extraordinarily compressed," containing both his life story and his advice for heroes. She memorizes every word.

We only get two direct quotes:

> "They are wounds in the world." (on Dementors, Ch. 45)

> "No rescuer hath the rescuer. No Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father, nothing above." (Ch. 75)

And one tantalizing detail from Chapter 94: the Weasley twins are the Heirs of Gryffindor. When Harry expresses surprise—they don't seem like the Godric from history books—Dumbledore says something striking:

> "Only a man exceedingly proud and vain would believe that his heir should be like himself, rather than like who he wished that he could be."

So Godric wanted heirs who were *unlike* him. Lighter. More joyful. Able to laugh.

That got me thinking: what would thirty inches of compressed wisdom look like from a man like that? Someone who understood Dementors when everyone else flinched from the truth. Someone who founded a school to teach children differently than he was taught. Someone tired, and honest about being tired.

Here's my attempt at reconstruction.

## The Autobiography of Godric Gryffindor

---

I was born in the year of the Burning. My mother cast three spells I will never know.

The old wizards are gone now. We killed them, or they killed each other, or they simply stopped. I helped. I do not regret this. I have seen what the old knowledge does to those who hold it.

There were seventeen of us who swore the Compact of Wands. Four survive. Salazar keeps his own counsel. Rowena writes everything she can salvage, though the greatest spells will not stay on parchment—this is Merlin's gift to us, that we cannot destroy ourselves as quickly as our fathers did. Helga heals what can be healed.

I build walls.

---

We are making a school because children should not learn magic the way I learned it: in desperation, in war, with masters who saw students as weapons or shields. If we teach them young, teach them together, perhaps they will not become what we became.

---

I have done terrible things for good reasons. I have done good things that became terrible. I cannot always tell which is which until years later, and sometimes not even then.

Do not trust your reasons. Trust your results. But you will not know your results until you are too old to change them.

This is the trap.

---

I loved three times. I killed two of them. The third I could not save.

This is not a confession. This is arithmetic.

---

Salazar believes blood determines worth. He is wrong, but I understand why he believes it. He watched the Muggle-borns die first in every battle—not from weakness, but from ignorance we had no time to remedy. He concluded the wrong thing from correct observations.

I have tried to show him otherwise. I am failing.

Rowena believes knowledge determines worth. She hoards everything, trusts nothing to memory alone, writes in seven codes. She does not understand that Merlin's Interdict exists because some knowledge is not safe to preserve. She will learn, or her descendants will learn for her.

Helga believes everyone has worth. She is correct. She is also the most dangerous of us, because she will not choose who to save when there is not enough time. I have watched her freeze. I have watched people die while she calculated fairness.

I believe that someone must choose. I believe the choice corrupts the chooser. I believe we must be corrupted so others need not be.

This is what it means to hold a sword.

---

I have seen what happens when a Dementor's kiss takes a man. The old wizards called them servants of darkness, demons, spirits of despair.

They are none of these things.

**Dementors are wounds in the world.**

The fear you feel near them is not their weapon. It is your mind recognizing what it sees. You feel fear near a cliff's edge too. The cliff is not made of fear.

I do not know what made the wounds. Perhaps nothing did. Perhaps wounds are what happens when there is not enough of something, and Death is what remains when there is not enough life.

I am no philosopher. I only know that attacking a wound makes it larger.

---

**No rescuer hath the rescuer. No Lord hath the champion, no mother and no father, nothing above.**

If you would be a hero, know this: you will make decisions no one else is willing to make. You will be wrong sometimes. You will not be forgiven, because forgiveness requires someone with standing to grant it, and you will have no one above you.

You will be alone with your choices, and your choices will be alive when you are dust.

Choose anyway.

---

I am tired. I have been tired for thirty years. I do not regret the weariness. I regret the things I did while well-rested, when I still had the energy for cruelty I called righteousness.

I have never learned to laugh at the right things. Helga tries to teach me. I am a poor student in this one subject.

If I could choose my heir, I would choose someone who laughs easily and fears little. Someone who makes mischief without malice. I was not that boy. Perhaps my line will produce him someday.

---

We open the school in spring. Helga says the mandrakes will be ready. Rowena has finished the sorting enchantment—it will read hearts, she says, though not as truly as Merlin's Mirror. Salazar has warded the lower chambers. I have argued against this. I have lost.

To whoever reads this: we built something. Probably it will be corrupted. Probably you are dealing with the consequences of our failures. This is how it works. You will build something too, and your children's children will curse your name for the problems you could not foresee.

Build anyway.

---

Be brave. Not fearless—fear is information. Brave.

Do the thing while frightened. Do the thing while uncertain. Do the thing while exhausted, while grieving, while doubting everything including your right to act at all.

**Do the thing.**

---

I will die soon. Rowena's sight is rarely wrong, and she will not meet my eyes at supper.

This is good. I am tired, and there is no one left I need to kill.

Remember this: the old wizards had power we cannot imagine. They are gone. We have less power and more restraint. We are still here.

The Interdict holds. The school will open. The children will learn to be better than us.

This is enough. This has to be enough.

*—Godric, in the 73rd year of my age, setting down my wand*

## Author's Notes

**What I tried to do:**

- Honor the two canonical quotes by building context around them
- Explain why Fred and George make sense as his heirs (he valued what he lacked)
- Connect to HPMOR's themes: the Interdict, the nature of Dementors, heroic responsibility
- Give each Founder a coherent philosophy that explains their later conflict
- Write in a "compressed" style befitting thirty inches of scroll
- Make it feel like something Hermione would memorize five times over

**Easter eggs for the attentive:**

- "Merlin's Mirror" foreshadows the Mirror of Erised's true origins
- The "Compact of Wands" implies a post-catastrophe agreement among survivors
- Salazar's reasoning mirrors real historical prejudices: blaming victims for circumstances
- "Attacking a wound makes it larger" directly connects to why conventional Patronuses don't destroy Dementors
- The sorting enchantment "reads hearts"—same principle as the Mirror, lesser implementation

**What I deliberately left ambiguous:**

- Who Godric loved and killed (readers can speculate)
- What exactly "the Burning" was
- Whether Salazar's "lower chambers" are the Chamber of Secrets
- How much Godric knew about Merlin's actual history

Thoughts? Does this feel like something that belongs in the HPMOR universe?
