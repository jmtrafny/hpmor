## Thematic Differences [IMPLIED]

### Core Philosophy

    - **Canon**: Some magic is simply mysterious and wonderful
    - **Key difference**: Reductionism vs. acceptance of wonder

## What Hasn't Changed (Common Mistakes)

### Keep These Canon Elements

47. **Hogwarts Houses Still Exist**: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff [Ch. 12]

48. **Basic Magical Creatures**: Dragons, unicorns, phoenixes, Dementors exist (even if mechanics differ) [Throughout]

49. **Basic Spell Names**: Wingardium Leviosa, Expecto Patronum, Avada Kedavra, etc. mostly unchanged [Throughout]

50. **Diagon Alley, Gringotts, Basic Locations**: Still exist with same names [Ch. 2, throughout]

51. **Quidditch Exists** (though Harry wants to eliminate Snitch): Game is still played [Ch. 35]

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

### Critical Rules

**DO**:
- Remember story takes place in Year One only
- Harry is rationalist scientist, not instinctive hero
- Hermione is proactive leader, died and was resurrected
- Draco is redeemable, has real friendship with Harry
- Quirrell is competent Voldemort, brilliant teacher
- Partial Transfiguration requires physics understanding
- True Patronus can destroy Dementors
- Source of Magic is Atlantean system
- Death is the enemy (not accepted)

**DON'T**:
- Bring in canon plot elements from years 2-7
- Make Harry act like canon Harry (emotional, instinctive)
- Treat Hermione as support character
- Make Draco irredeemable villain
- Use traditional Horcrux mechanics (HPMOR's are different)
- Forget Hermione died and was resurrected
- Ignore that Voldemort is permanently defeated
- Make Dumbledore omniscient

### Common Contamination Points

**Watch Out For**:
1. **Year progression**: Story doesn't continue to Year Two
2. **Character ages**: Everyone is 11 throughout
3. **Hermione's status**: She's resurrected, has unicorn-like properties
4. **Voldemort's fate**: Permanently dead, no return possible
5. **Horcrux hunt**: Doesn't happen, different mechanics
6. **Ron's role**: Less prominent in HPMOR (not in trio)
7. **Harry's upbringing**: Loving, educated, not abused
8. **Snape's ending**: Escapes and lives, not tragic death
