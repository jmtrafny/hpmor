# Loose Threads - Story Hooks and Unexplored Possibilities

## Overview

HPMOR ends with many threads left open—not plot holes, but **intentional opportunities** for readers and fanfiction writers to explore. Eliezer deliberately left space for continuation, speculation, and creative expansion. This file catalogs character arcs to continue, plot hooks to develop, mysteries to explore, and potential sequel hooks that don't contradict HPMOR canon.

**Purpose**: Inspire fanfiction writers with story ideas that build on HPMOR without breaking it.
