# Common Pitfalls - Mistakes to Avoid When Writing HPMOR Fanfiction

## Overview

This file catalogs the most common mistakes writers make when creating HPMOR fanfiction, organized by category. Use this as a checklist before publishing to catch errors that break HPMOR canon, characterization, or internal consistency.

## Magic System Pitfalls

### Time-Turner Paradoxes [EXPLICIT]

1. **MISTAKE: Creating Information from Future**
   - **Problem**: Having characters receive information from their future selves that couldn't exist without time loop
   - **Why it's wrong**: Magic explicitly prevents information from future [Ch. 17, 61]
   - **Correct approach**: Time loops must be self-consistent; information must already exist
   - **Example error**: "Future Harry sent note saying 'Attack at 3pm' → Present Harry prevents attack → But if attack prevented, future Harry wouldn't know about it to send note"
   - **Fix**: Information must come from stable loop, not created paradox

2. **MISTAKE: Ignoring 6-Hour Limit**
   - **Problem**: Characters using Time-Turner to go back more than 6 hours
   - **Why it's wrong**: Explicit limit in canon [Ch. 17]
   - **Correct approach**: Maximum 6 hours back, and can't use more than 6 hours per day total
   - **Writer note**: This is a hard limit, not flexible

3. **MISTAKE: Treating Time-Turner as Save-Scum Device**
   - **Problem**: "Try something, if it fails, go back and try differently"
   - **Why it's wrong**: Magic enforces consistency; if you went back, you already went back
   - **Correct approach**: Can only do things that fit consistent timeline
   - **Example**: If Harry didn't see time-turned self during event, he can't have been there

### Transfiguration Safety Violations [EXPLICIT]

4. **MISTAKE: Ignoring Transfiguration Time Limits**
   - **Problem**: Transfigured objects lasting indefinitely
   - **Why it's wrong**: Transfiguration wears off eventually [Ch. 22-23]
   - **Correct approach**: Powerful wizards maintain longer, but all Transfiguration temporary unless maintained
   - **Safety note**: Why you can't Transfigure food (would revert inside stomach)

5. **MISTAKE: Free Transfiguration Everywhere**
   - **Problem**: Characters Transfiguring anything anytime with no cost or difficulty
   - **Why it's wrong**: Transfiguration has limits, requires concentration, skill matters [Ch. 22-23, 28-29]
   - **Correct approach**: More complex Transfigurations harder; maintaining many objects difficult
   - **First-year limit**: Students can do simple Transfigurations, not complex ones

6. **MISTAKE: Everyone Can Do Partial Transfiguration**
   - **Problem**: Having characters besides Harry do partial Transfiguration without physics understanding
   - **Why it's wrong**: Requires thinking at atomic level, understanding physics [Ch. 28-29]
   - **Correct approach**: Only those who understand atoms/physics can do it
   - **Teaching limit**: Interdict of Merlin prevents teaching powerful magic through writing

### Interdict of Merlin Violations [EXPLICIT]

7. **MISTAKE: Powerful Magic from Books**
   - **Problem**: Characters learning powerful spells from reading books
   - **Why it's wrong**: Interdict of Merlin prevents teaching powerful magic through writing [Ch. 23]
   - **Correct approach**: Powerful magic requires personal instruction from living caster
   - **Implication**: Knowledge is lost when powerful wizards die without teaching
   - **Example**: Can't learn partial Transfiguration from textbook, needs Harry to teach personally

8. **MISTAKE: Ignoring Knowledge Loss**
   - **Problem**: Assuming all magical knowledge is preserved
   - **Why it's wrong**: Interdict causes knowledge loss across generations [Ch. 23]
   - **Correct approach**: Many spells/techniques lost because wizards died without teaching
   - **Story opportunity**: Discovering lost magic

### Making Magic Too Easy or Too Hard

9. **MISTAKE: Magic Solves Every Problem**
   - **Problem**: "Just use magic" for any difficulty
   - **Why it's wrong**: Magic has limits, costs, skill requirements
   - **Correct approach**: Magic is powerful tool with constraints
   - **Balance**: First-years are limited; adults more capable but still constrained

10. **MISTAKE: Magic Impossibly Hard**
    - **Problem**: Making canonical spells too difficult for characters at appropriate skill level
    - **Why it's wrong**: Eleven-year-olds can cast Patronus if taught properly [Ch. 43]
    - **Correct approach**: Skill and understanding matter more than age for many spells
    - **Example**: Children learning Patronus (Quirrell proves Ministry wrong about age requirements)

## Character Voice Pitfalls

### Harry Potter

11. **MISTAKE: Harry Talking Like Canon Harry**
    - **Problem**: Emotional, instinctive responses instead of analytical
    - **Why it's wrong**: HPMOR Harry is rationalist who analyzes before acting [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Harry uses scientific terminology, questions assumptions, notices confusion
    - **Example errors**:
      - "I just knew it was right" → Harry would analyze why
      - "Magic is amazing!" → Harry would ask "How does this work?"
      - Accepting mysterious answers → Harry demands mechanisms

12. **MISTAKE: Harry as Emotionless Logic Robot**
    - **Problem**: Making Harry purely logical with no feelings
    - **Why it's wrong**: Harry feels deeply (loves Hermione, protects friends, has "dark side") [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Harry is emotional AND rational, struggles to integrate them
    - **Key**: Emotions are data; Harry analyzes them but still feels them

13. **MISTAKE: Harry Not Using Rationalist Terminology**
    - **Problem**: Harry speaking without Bayesian reasoning, cognitive biases, scientific method references
    - **Why it's wrong**: This vocabulary is core to his character [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Sprinkle in "prior probability," "notice confusion," "fundamental attribution error," etc.
    - **Balance**: Don't overdo it, but Harry should use these concepts naturally

14. **MISTAKE: Forgetting Harry is 11**
    - **Problem**: Harry acting like adult in all ways
    - **Why it's wrong**: He's brilliant 11-year-old, not adult [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Exceptional intelligence but limited life experience
    - **Examples**: Still capable of childish reactions, doesn't know everything adults know

### Hermione Granger

15. **MISTAKE: Hermione as Pure Rule-Follower**
    - **Problem**: Making her canon Hermione who always follows rules
    - **Why it's wrong**: HPMOR Hermione is proactive, founded S.P.H.E.W., leads army, willing to break rules for good [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Hermione has strong moral code, but it's about DOING GOOD, not following rules
    - **Example**: Runs toward danger to save Harry from Dementor [Ch. 44]

16. **MISTAKE: Hermione as Support Character**
    - **Problem**: Treating her as secondary to Harry
    - **Why it's wrong**: She's co-protagonist, General Sunshine, founder of S.P.H.E.W. [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Hermione drives plots, leads others, takes initiative
    - **Key**: She's proactive hero, not reactive support

17. **MISTAKE: Ignoring Hermione's Death and Resurrection**
    - **Problem**: Writing as if she never died
    - **Why it's wrong**: She was killed by troll, preserved by Harry, resurrected [Ch. 89, 122]
    - **Correct approach**: Post-resurrection Hermione has experienced death, has "unicorn-like properties"
    - **Implication**: This transforms her; can't ignore it

### Professor Quirrell / Voldemort

18. **MISTAKE: Quirrell Showing Too Much Emotion**
    - **Problem**: Making him expressive, emotional, or losing composure
    - **Why it's wrong**: Extremely controlled, shows emotion rarely [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Cold, calculating, controlled even when manipulating
    - **Rare exceptions**: Deterioration (zombie states), sense of doom with Harry

19. **MISTAKE: Quirrell Being Incompetent**
    - **Problem**: Making him fail due to stupidity
    - **Why it's wrong**: Terrifyingly intelligent and competent [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: If Quirrell fails, it's because opposed by equal/greater intelligence or luck, not because he's dumb
    - **Key**: He's worthy opponent, not plot-device villain

20. **MISTAKE: Calling Harry Anything But "Mr. Potter"**
    - **Problem**: Quirrell using "Harry" or first name
    - **Why it's wrong**: Always "Mr. Potter," never informal [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Formal address maintained even in private
    - **Exception**: Possibly different in Parseltongue, but still formal

### Albus Dumbledore

21. **MISTAKE: Dumbledore as Omniscient**
    - **Problem**: Dumbledore knowing everything, planning everything perfectly
    - **Why it's wrong**: He makes real mistakes in HPMOR [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Competent and powerful but limited, makes errors
    - **Examples**: Traps Harry at Hogwarts (wrong call), misjudges Hermione situation, manipulations backfire

22. **MISTAKE: Dumbledore as Evil Mastermind**
    - **Problem**: Making him purely evil manipulator
    - **Why it's wrong**: He genuinely tries to do good, just uses questionable methods [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Tragic figure who means well but manipulates "for greater good"
    - **Key**: Sympathetic villain, not pure evil

23. **MISTAKE: Missing the "Twinkling" Performance**
    - **Problem**: Writing Dumbledore as genuinely whimsical
    - **Why it's wrong**: "Twinkling" is deliberate performance, tool [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Whimsy is mask; underneath is sorrow and burden
    - **Show**: Distinguish performance from rare genuine moments

## Plot Pitfalls

### Timeline Errors

24. **MISTAKE: Story Continuing Past Year One**
    - **Problem**: Writing Year Two, Year Three, etc.
    - **Why it's wrong**: HPMOR story ends after Year One [Ch. 122]
    - **Correct approach**: If writing sequel, acknowledge it's post-canon, extrapolation
    - **Note**: Canon covers seven years; HPMOR only one

25. **MISTAKE: Characters Aging**
    - **Problem**: Characters being 12, 13, 14+ during HPMOR events
    - **Why it's wrong**: Everyone is 11 throughout story [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: All events happen within single school year
    - **Implication**: Maturity limited by age

26. **MISTAKE: Bringing in Canon Plot Elements**
    - **Problem**: Chamber of Secrets, Triwizard Tournament, OWLs, etc.
    - **Why it's wrong**: These happen in later years; HPMOR doesn't reach them [Timeline]
    - **Correct approach**: Stick to Year One events and setup
    - **Alternative**: Explicitly AU divergence if you want these elements

### Hermione's Status

27. **MISTAKE: Hermione Being Alive Whole Time**
    - **Problem**: Ignoring her death
    - **Why it's wrong**: She died in Ch. 89, resurrected in Ch. 122 [Explicit]
    - **Correct approach**: Reference death, resurrection, transformation
    - **Details**: Has "unicorn-like properties" post-resurrection

28. **MISTAKE: Hermione Going to Azkaban**
    - **Problem**: Writing as if she was imprisoned
    - **Why it's wrong**: Harry spent Potter fortune to save her [Ch. 82-84]
    - **Correct approach**: She was debt-ward to House Potter, not imprisoned
    - **Follow-up**: Debt resolved, House Granger established [Ch. 122]

### Voldemort's Fate

29. **MISTAKE: Voldemort Returning**
    - **Problem**: Bringing back Voldemort after final confrontation
    - **Why it's wrong**: Harry killed him permanently [Ch. 113-115]
    - **Complication**: 100+ Horcruxes exist but locations unknown even to Voldemort [Ch. 108]
    - **Correct approach**: If writing Voldemort return, explain how Horcrux was found despite being in space/mantle/trench
    - **Note**: Story strongly implies he's gone for good

30. **MISTAKE: Traditional Horcrux Hunt**
    - **Problem**: Characters searching for seven Horcruxes in findable locations
    - **Why it's wrong**: HPMOR has 100+ Horcruxes in impossible locations [Ch. 108]
    - **Correct approach**: Horcruxes are: Pioneer plaque (in space), Mariana Trench, Earth's mantle, stratosphere, anonymous cubic meter of crust
    - **Key**: Voldemort Obliviated exact locations from himself

## Thematic Pitfalls

### Rationality

31. **MISTAKE: Missing Rationalist Elements**
    - **Problem**: Writing HPMOR fic without rationality theme
    - **Why it's wrong**: Rationality is core to story [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Characters (especially Harry) use scientific method, update beliefs, notice confusion
    - **Balance**: Don't lecture, but show rational thinking in action

32. **MISTAKE: Rationality Solves Everything**
    - **Problem**: Rational thinking instantly solves all problems
    - **Why it's wrong**: Problems are hard even with clear thinking [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Rationality helps but isn't magic solution
    - **Example**: Harry thinks rationally but still fails to save Hermione initially [Ch. 89]

33. **MISTAKE: Everyone Becoming Rational**
    - **Problem**: All characters suddenly thinking like Harry
    - **Why it's wrong**: Most wizards don't think scientifically [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Contrast Harry's rationality with others' traditional thinking
    - **Note**: Some can learn (Draco, Hermione) but it's gradual

### Death

34. **MISTAKE: Harry Accepting Death**
    - **Problem**: Harry saying death is natural or acceptable
    - **Why it's wrong**: "Death is the enemy" is central to his character [Ch. 39, 45, 96]
    - **Correct approach**: Harry NEVER accepts death as good or natural
    - **Exception**: Might accept specific deaths as necessary evil, but still bad

35. **MISTAKE: Dumbledore Rejecting Death**
    - **Problem**: Dumbledore agreeing with Harry about death
    - **Why it's wrong**: Fundamental philosophical divide between them [Ch. 39]
    - **Correct approach**: Dumbledore accepts death as "next great adventure"
    - **Conflict**: This opposition drives much of their dynamic

### Ethics

36. **MISTAKE: Harry Following Rules Blindly**
    - **Problem**: Harry refusing to break rules
    - **Why it's wrong**: Consequentialist who breaks rules when outcomes justify it [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Harry uses rules as heuristics but overrides them when necessary
    - **Example**: Breaks into Azkaban because consequencesof saving innocent outweigh rule against breaking in

37. **MISTAKE: Harry Being Amoral**
    - **Problem**: Harry not caring about right/wrong
    - **Why it's wrong**: He cares deeply about outcomes, suffering, welfare [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Consequentialist ethics - outcomes matter tremendously
    - **Key**: Not "anything goes"; actions judged by consequences

## Worldbuilding Pitfalls

### Magic Origin

38. **MISTAKE: Magic as Natural**
    - **Problem**: Treating magic as natural phenomenon
    - **Why it's wrong**: Magic is Atlantean artifact, engineered system [Ch. 25, 108]
    - **Correct approach**: Magic has creator, uses DNA authentication, was designed
    - **Implication**: Magic has purpose, limits, potentially exploitable

39. **MISTAKE: Ignoring Source of Magic**
    - **Problem**: Not considering that magic is system with rules
    - **Why it's wrong**: Source of Magic enforces Interdict, time rules, etc. [Ch. 108]
    - **Correct approach**: Magic's limitations come from system design
    - **Story opportunity**: Discovering more about Atlantis or Source

### Politics

40. **MISTAKE: Ignoring House Granger**
    - **Problem**: Writing post-canon without mentioning House Granger
    - **Why it's wrong**: Harry established first Muggle-born Noble House [Ch. 122]
    - **Correct approach**: Major political change, should affect society
    - **Implication**: Precedent for other Muggle-borns' elevation

41. **MISTAKE: Blood Purity Still Dominant**
    - **Problem**: Writing as if nothing changed politically
    - **Why it's wrong**: Death Eaters eliminated, Voldemort defeated, House Granger established [Ch. 113-122]
    - **Correct approach**: Major political shift occurred
    - **Note**: Doesn't mean blood purists gone, but power balance shifted

### Technology

42. **MISTAKE: Forgetting Muggle Science**
    - **Problem**: Not considering how Muggle technology could interact with magic
    - **Why it's wrong**: Harry uses partial Transfiguration, nanowire, other Muggle concepts [Throughout]
    - **Correct approach**: Muggle science and magic can combine
    - **Example**: Harry kills Death Eaters with Transfigured carbon nanotube through ground [Ch. 113-115]

## Consistency Pitfalls

### Internal Contradictions

43. **MISTAKE: Violating Established Facts**
    - **Problem**: Contradicting explicit HPMOR canon
    - **Why it's wrong**: Breaks reader immersion
    - **How to avoid**: Check world guide files before writing
    - **Examples**: Wrong house sorting, wrong character ages, wrong spell mechanics

44. **MISTAKE: Character Acting Out of Character**
    - **Problem**: Character does something inconsistent with established personality
    - **Why it's wrong**: Breaks characterization
    - **How to avoid**: Consult character profiles, voice guides
    - **Note**: Characters can grow, but changes need justification

45. **MISTAKE: Ignoring Story Consequences**
    - **Problem**: Not following through on implications of events
    - **Why it's wrong**: HPMOR emphasizes consequences matter
    - **Correct approach**: Actions have ripple effects; track them
    - **Example**: Harry spending fortune affects his resources going forward
