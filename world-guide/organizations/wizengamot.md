# The Wizengamot

## Overview

The Wizengamot is magical Britain's legislative body and high court, composed of Lords and Ladies of Noble Houses who wear plum-coloured robes embroidered with silver 'W'. HPMOR portrays it as a deeply political institution prone to mob dynamics, blood-purist influence, and self-serving decisions, presided over by the Chief Warlock Albus Dumbledore.

## Physical Setting: The Most Ancient Hall [EXPLICIT]

### Architecture [Ch. 80]

- **Location**: Center of Ministry building (Ministry grew up around it)
- **Age**: "The oldest place of wizardry that has lasted into the modern day" [Ch. 80]
- **Design**: Concentric half-circles of stone rising from lowest centre
- **Seating**: Simple wooden benches on elevated half-circles
- **Materials**: Dark stone walls "some elegant and mysterious conjugation of rock most fine to gaze upon, with a smooth texture that seems to flow and shift beneath its surface"
- **Lighting**: Well-lit "without any apparent cause or reason; it is simply a brute fact that the hall is well-lit"
- **Indestructibility**: Walls "would pass unharmed, and perhaps unwarmed, through the heart of a nuclear explosion" [Ch. 80]

### Legend of Construction [Ch. 80]

According to legend (though Asian countries "tell other tales entirely"):
- Walls conjured by Merlin when he gathered most powerful remaining wizards
- Built to end the wars by creating permanent seat of power
- Merlin sacrificed "his life, and his wizardry, and his time" to lay the Interdict of Merlin
- Modern wizards cannot recreate or destroy this construction

### Layout Features [Ch. 80]

- **Highest Circle**: Chief Warlock's podium
- **Topmost Level**: Seats for most senior Lords/Ladies (Lucius Malfoy sits here)
- **Bottommost Platform**: High-backed chair of dark metal "which Merlin did not place there" (for witnesses under questioning)
- **Visitor Arc**: Raised arc for spectators (Harry and McGonagall sit here)
- **Secretary Position**: Bottom circle (tallies votes)
- **Witness Door**: Set beneath visitor seats

## Leadership and Structure

### Chief Warlock [EXPLICIT Ch. 80]

**Current**: Albus Dumbledore

**Symbol of Office**: Line of Merlin Unbroken
- Short rod, thin and featureless, forged of same dark stone as walls
- Passed from Chief Warlock to chosen successor in unbroken chain since Merlin
- Karen Dutton bequeathed it to Dumbledore after his defeat of Grindelwald
- Each Chief Warlock's "most important duty": "exercise the highest caution in their choice of people who are both good and able to discern good successors"

**Powers and Responsibilities**:
- Presides over Wizengamot sessions
- Cannot be voted out (position held by tradition, not election)
- Can call for order (tapping stone rod produces clicks that silence room)
- Can rule procedural matters
- Limited ability to block votes once majority has formed

**Political Reality**:
- Dumbledore's faction: "Forces of good saving their political capital for more winnable battles" [Ch. 80]
- Only one with status high enough to "speak a word of sanity and escape unscathed" [Ch. 80]
- But cannot override blood-purist majority on issues they care about

### Secretary [EXPLICIT Ch. 80]

- Sits in bottom circle
- Tallies votes by show of hands
- Records results on parchment
- Announces vote outcomes: "The vote carries, in favour" [Ch. 81]

## Membership

### Composition [IMPLIED]

- Lords and Ladies of Noble and Most Ancient Houses
- Appears to include some appointed seats (exact ratio unclear)
- Wear plum-coloured robes embroidered with silver 'W' [Ch. 80]

### Political Factions [Ch. 80]

**Malfoy-Aligned (Blood Purist)**:
- Led by Lucius Malfoy
- Majority faction
- Comfortable calling for Azkaban for Muggle-borns
- Described by Quirrell: "Ambitious, few have any ambition...exactly where someone like that would end up" [Ch. 80]

**Dumbledore-Aligned**:
- Minority faction
- Includes Augusta Longbottom (sharp critic), Amelia Bones (DMLE head)
- One witch "quite deliberately stood up" and switched to Malfoy side during Hermione's trial [Ch. 80]
- Largely silent during Hermione's trial, "saving their political capital for more winnable battles"

**Neutral/Middle**:
- "Plum-coloured robes in the middle" occasionally shocked by extreme proposals [Ch. 81]
- Sway-able by political pressure and optics

### Named Members [EXPLICIT]

- **Albus Dumbledore**: Chief Warlock [Ch. 80]
- **Lucius Malfoy**: Senior member, tall man with long white hair, wields silver cane [Ch. 80]
- **Augusta Longbottom**: Neville's grandmother, sharp-voiced critic [Ch. 80]
- **Amelia Bones**: Head of DMLE, stern old witch [Ch. 80]
- **Cornelius Fudge**: Minister for Magic (attends trials) [Ch. 80]
- **Dolores Umbridge**: Woman with "puffy and overweight" face, wearing heavy pink make-up; sits next to Fudge [Ch. 80]

### Harry's Perspective [Ch. 80]

Initially views members as:
- "Wallpaper" - visual background with "collective force, but not individual agency"
- "PC vs. wallpaper" mentality: "He is a PC, and they are wallpaper"
- **This view changes** during trial: "This view is about to change" [Ch. 80]

By trial's end: "Harry had declared war on the country of magical Britain" [Ch. 80]

## Voting Procedures

### Standard Process [EXPLICIT Ch. 80-82]

1. **Motion Proposed**: Lord/Lady presents motion
2. **Deliberations**: Members speak for/against (though often perfunctory)
3. **Call for Vote**: Proposer calls for vote
4. **Show of Hands**: Members raise hands
5. **Tally**: Secretary counts and records
6. **Announcement**: Secretary intones result
7. **Ruling Enacted**: Decision immediately binding

### Vote Mechanics [Ch. 80-82]

- **Method**: Show of hands ("I think a show of hands will suffice for it") [Ch. 80]
- **Quorum**: Not specified (appears all sessions are properly convened)
- **Majority**: Simple majority appears sufficient
- **Speed**: Can be rushed if majority is clear
- **Intimidation**: "I do not imagine there will be many who choose to align themselves with murderers" - threat implicit [Ch. 80]

### Types of Votes [Ch. 80-82]

1. **Recognition of Blood Debt**: "The Wizengamot recognizes the blood debt owed by Hermione Granger to House Malfoy" [Ch. 81]
2. **Sentencing**: Azkaban sentence for attempted murder
3. **Monetary Compensation**: Additional 100,000 Galleons to cancel blood debt [Ch. 81]
4. **Procedural Matters**: Handled by Chief Warlock, not voted

## Legal Proceedings

### Trial Format [Ch. 80]

**Convening**:
- "The ninetieth session of the two-hundred-and-eighth Wizengamot is convened at the request of Lord Lucius Malfoy" [Ch. 80]
- Numbered sessions suggest regular formal structure

**Witness Examination**:
1. Witness brought forth under Auror guard
2. Seated in dark metal chair (chains emerge to bind arms and legs)
3. Administered Veritaserum (three drops)
4. Questioned under truth serum
5. Testimony read aloud if witness absent (Draco's testimony) [Ch. 80]

**Dementor Presence**:
- Permitted to guard high-value/dangerous prisoners during testimony
- Animal Patronuses provided for protection (but imperfect)
- Dumbledore: "I will brook no abuse of this witness" (ignored) [Ch. 80]
- Harry protests bringing Dementor near twelve-year-old girl (overruled) [Ch. 80]

**Deliberations**:
- Chief Warlock and select members speak
- Often theatrical and performative rather than genuine debate
- "If you could call them that" [Ch. 80]

### Veritaserum Use [EXPLICIT Ch. 80]

- Standard for witness testimony
- Three drops administered
- Face grows slack under influence
- Wears off after questioning complete (Hermione's face "twisting beneath the slackness" near end) [Ch. 80]
- Can be used on absent witnesses (Draco questioned separately, testimony read aloud) [Ch. 80]
- Trusted Auror (Gawain Robards) conducts questioning: "Your probity is known to all of us" [Ch. 80]

## Blood Debt and Ancient House Law [EXPLICIT]

### Blood Debt Principles [Ch. 80-82]

**Definition**: Debt owed when one person attempts to end line of Noble and Most Ancient House

**Hermione's Case**:
1. **Blood Debt Recognized**: Vote acknowledges "blood debt owed by Hermione Granger to House Malfoy for the attempted murder of its scion and ending of its line" [Ch. 81]
2. **Two Debts Distinguished**:
   - Debt for attempt on Draco's life
   - Separate debt for Narcissa's blood (alluded to but not explained) [Ch. 80]
3. **Payment Options**:
   - Azkaban sentence (10 years for attempted murder)
   - Monetary compensation (100,000 Galleons demanded)
   - Being "sworn as debt-ward to another House" [Ch. 83]

### Redemption Process [Ch. 81-83]

Lucius offers deal:
- Hermione can be "claimed by any Lord or Lady of a Noble House"
- Becomes "debt-ward" to that House
- Blood debt transferred to new House
- Must pay 100,000 Galleons in addition

Harry's Acceptance:
- Offers "every Galleon in Potter family vaults, including family heirlooms" [Ch. 82]
- Commits to paying 100,000 Galleons
- Hermione sworn to House Potter [Ch. 83]
- Wizengamot votes to remand her to Harry's custody instead of Azkaban [Ch. 83]

## Power Dynamics and Politics

### Dumbledore's Limitations [Ch. 80]

Despite being Chief Warlock:
- Cannot override blood-purist majority
- Refuses Lucius's offer to confess own crime to save Hermione
- Amelia Bones: "You know the answer you must give, Albus. It will not change for agonizing over it." [Ch. 80]
- Lucius: "I only wished to show the Wizengamot the truth behind this old man's pretended heroism...that he would hardly think of sacrificing himself to save her" [Ch. 80]

### Malfoy's Influence [Ch. 80-82]

- Commands majority through blood-purist faction
- Can call votes and expect them to pass
- Controls narrative ("blood calls for repayment")
- Uses procedural knowledge and legal technicalities expertly
- Threatens Amelia Bones: "We can easily find another to serve in your place" if Aurors refuse Azkaban duty [Ch. 80]

### Public Opinion and Press [Ch. 80]

- **Daily Prophet** present (man with newsman's cap "avidly scribbling") [Ch. 80]
- Morning paper: "Mad Muggle-born Tries To End Ancient Line"
- Leading article called for lowering minimum age for Azkaban
- "Twisted mudblood," "savage, unprovoked attack," "foreign, subhuman brutes" [Ch. 80]
- Political indignation has "essential emptiness...trying to score cheap points by hitting at the same safe target" [Ch. 80]

### Mob Dynamics [Ch. 80]

**Escalation Pattern**:
1. Malfoy proposes sentence
2. Scarred man at his right: "Azkaban! Send the mad mudblood to Azkaban!" [Ch. 80]
3. Others join: "Azkaban!" "cried another plum-coloured robe, and then another, and another" [Ch. 80]
4. Becomes "great cheer of rage" [Ch. 80]
5. Anyone opposing risks "align[ing] themselves with murderers" [Ch. 80]

## HPMOR vs Canon Differences

**Retained from Canon**:
- Wizengamot as legislative body and high court
- Chief Warlock position (Dumbledore)
- Plum-coloured robes with silver 'W'
- Use of Veritaserum in trials
- Blood-purist faction's power

**HPMOR Specific Details**:
- **Most Ancient Hall description**: Extensive architectural lore about Merlin's construction (not in canon)
- **Line of Merlin Unbroken**: Dark stone rod symbolizing unbroken succession (HPMOR invention)
- **Detailed trial procedure**: More systematic than canon's vague proceedings
- **Blood debt mechanics**: Specific legal framework for Noble House debts
- **Debt-ward system**: Ability to transfer custody via blood debt payment
- **Harry's participation**: 11-year-old allowed to speak and make binding agreements (unusual)

**Tone Difference**:
- Canon Wizengamot: Incompetent but not actively malicious
- HPMOR Wizengamot: Self-serving political operators "who consider themselves the greatest folk of the world's greatest magical country" but are "rarely interesting...often useful; pieces to be manipulated" [Ch. 80]

## Key Scenes

- **Ch. 80**: Hermione's trial begins; Most Ancient Hall described; Harry witnesses Dementor near Hermione and "declares war on magical Britain"
- **Ch. 81**: Blood debt recognized; Lucius demands 100,000 Galleons; vote passes
- **Ch. 82**: Harry offers Potter fortune; Lucius accepts; negotiations over debt-ward status
- **Ch. 83**: Hermione sworn to House Potter; remanded to Harry's custody; Gringotts transfer
- **Ch. 84**: Aftermath of trial; Harry and Hermione process what occurred

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Wizengamot votes by simple majority, show of hands
- Blood debts are recognized legal category with specific payment requirements
- Chief Warlock position is hereditary-by-choice (Line of Merlin succession), not elected
- Veritaserum testimony is standard and trusted
- Most Ancient Hall is indestructible and lit by unknown magic
- Blood-purist majority controls most votes
- Members are "Lords and Ladies" suggesting Noble House membership

**What's Open to Interpretation**:
- Exact number of Wizengamot members [AMBIGUOUS]
- Ratio of hereditary to appointed seats [AMBIGUOUS]
- Whether quorum requirements exist [AMBIGUOUS]
- Full extent of Chief Warlock's powers beyond presiding
- How Line of Merlin succession has actually worked through history (Asian countries dispute British version) [AMBIGUOUS]
- Whether debt-ward system applies to non-trial situations

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't make Dumbledore all-powerful in Wizengamot - he's Chief Warlock but can't override majority
- Don't assume Wizengamot is competent or fair - HPMOR emphasizes political manipulation
- Don't forget blood debt mechanics are formalized legal procedure with specific payment options
- Don't ignore that Harry (age 11) can make binding legal agreements if Noble House heir
- Don't assume trials are fair - mob dynamics and factional voting dominate

**Useful for Stories**:
- Political intrigue involving faction management
- Blood debt plots requiring creative legal solutions
- Trial scenes with Veritaserum testimony
- Exploration of ancient magical architecture and Merlin's legacy
- Dumbledore's constrained power despite high position
- Class and blood purity themes via legal framework
