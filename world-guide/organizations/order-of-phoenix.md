# Order of the Phoenix

## Overview

The Order of the Phoenix is **not mentioned** in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Unlike canon, where Dumbledore's secret resistance organization played a major role in fighting Voldemort, HPMOR makes no reference to such an organization existing during the First Wizarding War or afterward.

## Absence from HPMOR [EXPLICIT]

### Canon Context

In canon Harry Potter, the Order of the Phoenix was:
- Secret organization founded by Albus Dumbledore
- Fought against Voldemort and Death Eaters during First Wizarding War
- Reformed in canon book 5 to fight Voldemort's return
- Included characters like James and Lily Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Mad-Eye Moody, etc.

### HPMOR Divergence

**No Textual Evidence**:
- Comprehensive search of all HPMOR chapters finds zero mentions of "Order of the Phoenix" or "Order of Phoenix"
- No description of organized resistance movement led by Dumbledore
- No references to secret headquarters, meetings, or coordinated operations
- James and Lily Potter's deaths mentioned, but no context of Order membership

**Implications**:
- First Wizarding War apparently fought without organized resistance movement
- Dumbledore may have acted independently or through other channels
- Individual heroes (Aurors, concerned citizens) fought Death Eaters without centralized organization
- Resistance may have been more ad-hoc and less coordinated than in canon

### What We Know About First War Resistance [IMPLIED]

**From HPMOR Text**:

1. **Aurors Fought**: "My grandson was an Auror. Died in seventy-nine" [Ch. 3]
   - Official Ministry forces engaged Death Eaters
   - Suffered casualties

2. **Dumbledore's Role**: [throughout]
   - Chief Warlock of Wizengamot during war
   - Powerful wizard who opposed Voldemort
   - No mention of leading secret organization

3. **Individual Heroes**: [Ch. 3]
   - Journalist Yermy Wibble called for action (killed for it)
   - "Everyone wished for something more to be done, and no-one dared take the lead to propose it"
   - Suggests lack of organized resistance leadership

4. **International Inaction**: [Ch. 3]
   - "Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene"
   - No mention of international Order chapters or coordination

### Why the Absence Matters

**Narrative Implications**:
- First War was more chaotic, less organized than canon
- No safe haven/headquarters for resistance fighters
- No coordinated intelligence gathering or strategy
- Resistance relied on individual courage rather than organization

**Character Implications**:
- James and Lily Potter died as individuals, not Order members
- Sirius Black's role unclear (arrested without trial for betraying Potters)
- No mentor figures from "old Order" for Harry to meet
- Dumbledore's leadership more institutional (Wizengamot) than insurgent

**Thematic Implications**:
- Emphasizes power of individuals over organizations
- Aligns with HPMOR's focus on personal agency and rationality
- Removes "secret good guys club" tropee common in YA fiction
- War portrayed as messy, uncoordinated, traumatic - not noble organized resistance

## HPMOR vs Canon Differences

**Canon**: Order of the Phoenix central to resistance against Voldemort in both wars

**HPMOR**: No Order of Phoenix exists; resistance to Voldemort apparently unorganized beyond official Ministry/Auror actions

## Speculation and Ambiguity [AMBIGUOUS]

**Possible In-Universe Explanations** (none confirmed by text):
1. Dumbledore never formed such organization
2. Organization existed but was so secret HPMOR narrative never mentions it
3. Organization existed under different name (no evidence for this)
4. Resistance was genuinely unorganized chaos

**Most Likely Interpretation**:
Given HPMOR's rational reconstruction of wizarding world and absence of any textual hint, the Order probably never existed in this timeline. First War was fought by brave individuals, official Aurors, and scattered resistance without centralized command.

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Order of the Phoenix never mentioned in HPMOR text
- No secret resistance headquarters or coordinated anti-Voldemort organization described
- First War fought through official channels (Aurors) and individual heroism

**What's Open to Interpretation** [AMBIGUOUS]:
- Whether Order exists but was never relevant to HPMOR's plot
- Whether Dumbledore created any informal network during First War
- How resistance actually coordinated (if at all)
- Whether James and Lily had allies beyond family/friends

**For Stories Set in HPMOR Universe**:
- Cannot assume Order exists without creating divergence from HPMOR
- First War plotlines should reflect unorganized resistance
- Dumbledore's wartime role likely political (Wizengamot) rather than insurgent leader
- Characters cannot reference "Order safe houses" or "Order missions"
- No "old Order members" available as mentors/allies

**If Including Order in HPMOR-Divergent Fic**:
- Must justify why it was never mentioned in HPMOR canon
- Consider why HPMOR chose to omit it (thematic reasons)
- May undercut HPMOR's emphasis on individual agency
- Creates tension with HPMOR's portrayal of messy, uncoordinated war

## Key Takeaway

The Order of the Phoenix does not exist in HPMOR's version of the wizarding world. This absence shapes how the First Wizarding War is understood: not as organized good vs. organized evil, but as chaotic terror met by scattered, often ineffective resistance. This aligns with HPMOR's more realistic (and grimmer) portrayal of war and emphasizes the agency of individual heroes like Harry rather than relying on established organizations.
