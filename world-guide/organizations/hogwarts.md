**Process**:

## Innovations: Battle Magic and Student Armies [EXPLICIT]

### Formation [Ch. 21, 22-34]

Professor Quirrell establishes student armies for tactical Battle Magic practice:

**Three Armies**:
1. **Dragon Army** - General Draco Malfoy
2. **Sunshine Regiment** - General Hermione Granger
3. **Chaos Legion** - General Harry Potter

**Purpose**: Teaching practical defense, tactics, leadership, and teamwork through simulated combat

### Army System Features [Ch. 22-34]

- Student soldiers volunteer to join armies
- Battles held in various locations (corridors, Hogwarts Lake)
- Complex scoring system
- Permitted use of "traitors" and spies
- Escalating tactical complexity leading to coordination problems
- Climactic three-way tie (254-254-254) orchestrated by Zabini [Ch. 34]

### Educational Value [IMPLIED]

- Develops strategic thinking and leadership
- Teaches cooperation under pressure
- Exposes coordination problems and game theory concepts
- Creates cross-House alliances and friendships

## Board of Governors [EXPLICIT]

**Composition** [Ch. 98]:
- Lord Lucius Malfoy (House Malfoy)
- Lady Augusta Longbottom (House Longbottom)
- Lord Charles Nott (House Nott)
- Lady Amelia Bones (House Bones)
- Daphne Greengrass (House Greengrass)
- Alanna Howe (House Howe)

**Powers**:
- Can pass Educational Decrees binding on Hogwarts
- Can suspend normal school operations (House Points system)
- Can authorize external forces (Aurors) on grounds
- Majority vote (4 of 6) required for Decrees

### Educational Decrees [EXPLICIT Ch. 98]

Passed following Hermione's death to ensure student safety:

1. **First Decree**: Students must travel in groups (specifics not detailed)
2. **Second Decree**: Nine Aurors dispatched to form "Auxiliary Protective Force"
3. **Third Decree**: House Points system suspended; solidarity between Houses mandated
4. **Fourth Decree**: Self-defense training for all students by Auror instructors
5. **Fifth Decree**: All corridor fighting prohibited outside Defence lessons
6. **Sixth Decree**: "Auxiliary Protective Special Committee" formed under Daphne Greengrass [Ch. 98]

## School Rules and Traditions

### Explicit Rules [EXPLICIT]

- **Forbidden Forest**: Forbidden to all students [Ch. 12]
  - Dumbledore: "That is why it is called the Forbidden Forest. If it were permitted it would be called the Permitted Forest"
- **Third-floor corridor** (right-hand side): Out of bounds to "everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death" [Ch. 12]
  - Guarded by "elaborate series of dangerous and potentially lethal traps"
- **No magic in corridors between classes** (frequently violated) [Ch. 12]

### Implicit Norms

- First-years not typically on Quidditch teams (can be waived)
- Students expected to respect professors (though enforcement varies)
- Prefects have authority to direct students [Ch. 9]

### Dumbledore's Modifications [IMPLIED]

- Third-floor trap sequence (unusual to announce death traps to students)
- Tolerance for Professor Quirrell despite "niggling complaints" expected [Ch. 12]
- Willingness to grant unusual privileges (Harry's Time-Turner) [Ch. 17]

## Student Government

### Prefects [EXPLICIT Ch. 9, 21]

- Two prefects per House per year (typically 5th-7th years)
- Authority to direct younger students
- Can assign tasks (helping lost first-years find compartments)
- **Ravenclaw Prefects mentioned**: Penelope Clearwater [Ch. 21]
- Six Ravenclaw prefects total, including Head Girl [Ch. 21]

### Head Boy/Head Girl [EXPLICIT]

- Head Girl of Hogwarts is a Ravenclaw (not named beyond this) [Ch. 21]
- Highest student authority position
- Works with prefects to maintain order

## HPMOR vs Canon Differences

**Major Divergences**:

1. **Student Armies**: Completely new to HPMOR - no canon equivalent to Quirrell's battle magic program
2. **Educational Decrees**: In canon, these are Ministry impositions (Umbridge era); here they're Board of Governors protections
3. **Neville's Sorting**: Canon places him in Gryffindor; HPMOR puts him in Hufflepuff [Ch. 9]
4. **House Unity Emphasis**: Crisis-driven cooperation formalized through Decrees [Ch. 98]
5. **Board of Governors**: More active and plot-relevant than in canon
6. **Quirrell's Competence**: Canon Quirrell is weak/stuttering throughout; HPMOR Quirrell alternates between personas and is highly capable

**Retained Elements**:
- Four Houses with traditional traits
- House Points system (when not suspended)
- Sorting Hat process
- Basic staff structure (though personalities differ)
- Prefect system

## Key Scenes

- **Ch. 9**: Sorting ceremony from Hermione's perspective; introduction to House system
- **Ch. 12**: Harry's Sorting (extended negotiation with Hat); Dumbledore's "boom boom swamp" speech
- **Ch. 13**: First feast; introduction to House dynamics
- **Ch. 14**: McGonagall's offer to award Harry enough points to win House Cup outright (he refuses)
- **Ch. 21-34**: Army battles throughout fall/winter term
- **Ch. 62**: Harry forbidden from leaving Hogwarts grounds by Dumbledore (post-Azkaban)
- **Ch. 76**: Sorting Hat's concerned song about current events
- **Ch. 98**: Educational Decrees announced; Silvery Slytherins conspiracy; Aurors deployed

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Four-House system with traditional values (though HPMOR interrogates them)
- Heads of House have significant authority over students
- Board of Governors can override Headmaster on policy via Educational Decrees
- Student armies exist and are sanctioned extra-curricular activity
- House Points can be suspended in crisis
- Prefect system functional and respected

**What's Open to Interpretation**:
- Exact mechanism of Sorting Hat's telepathy [AMBIGUOUS]
- How other Houses responded to army battles (focus is on Harry/Hermione/Draco)
- Details of most Educational Decree implementations
- Whether House Points system resumes after crisis [AMBIGUOUS]
- Fate of student armies after Quirrell's departure/defeat

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't assume Neville is in Gryffindor (he's Hufflepuff in HPMOR)
- Don't forget Educational Decrees are Board of Governors actions, not Ministry
- Don't write Quirrell as incompetent - he's brilliant (if persona-shifting)
- Don't assume House rivalry is absolute - HPMOR emphasizes cooperation under crisis
- Don't ignore that Dumbledore is both powerful AND perceived as eccentric/manipulative

**Useful for Story Scenes**:
- House Points as social pressure mechanism
- Army battles as action setpieces showing tactical creativity
- Board meetings for political intrigue
- Sorting scenes for character introduction/development
- Prefect authority for student leadership subplots
