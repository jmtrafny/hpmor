# Noble and Most Ancient Houses

## HPMOR vs Canon Differences

**Similarities to Canon**:
- Noble and Most Ancient Houses as aristocratic class
- Wizengamot seats associated with Noble Houses
- Blood purity ideology among some Noble Houses
- Houses Malfoy, Potter, Black, Bones, Longbottom, Greengrass, Nott exist
- Gringotts vaults for family wealth

**HPMOR Specific Details**:
- **Blood debt legal framework**: Detailed mechanics of blood debt and debt-wards [Ch. 80-83]

**Tone Difference**:

- HPMOR: Noble Houses as feudal remnant with explicit political-economic power analysis
- More emphasis on blood purity as cynical political tool vs. sincere (if wrong) belief
- Blood debt law more detailed and central to plot

## Key Scenes

- **Ch. 4**: McGonagall explains Harry's inheritance from "last heir of an old family"
- **Ch. 7**: Draco explains blood purity ideology; introduces "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black"
- **Ch. 16**: Quirrell addresses "Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy"
- **Ch. 17**: Harry refers to "Noble House of Potter" (note: not "Most Ancient")
- **Ch. 24**: Draco's wealth and willingness to loan to Harry Potter
- **Ch. 80-83**: Hermione's trial demonstrates blood debt law and Noble House power
- **Ch. 83**: Hermione becomes debt-ward to House Potter
- **Ch. 98**: Board of Governors (all Noble Houses) passes Educational Decrees
- **Ch. 122**: House Granger established as new Noble House

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Noble and Most Ancient Houses have Wizengamot seats and political power
- Blood debt law applies when Noble House line threatened
- Houses include: Malfoy, Potter, Black, Bones, Longbottom, Greengrass, Nott, Howe
- Board of Governors composed of Noble Houses controls Hogwarts policy
- Harry is "last heir" of House Potter with substantial inherited wealth
- Hermione founds House Granger as first Muggle-born Noble House
- Blood purity ideology was Voldemort's political tool, not sincere belief

**What's Open to Interpretation** [AMBIGUOUS]:
- Total number of Noble and Most Ancient Houses
- Exact criteria for "Noble" vs. "Noble and Most Ancient" designation
- Whether Harry's "Noble House of Potter" is less ancient than "Noble and Most Ancient" Houses
- How many Non-Noble families have Wizengamot seats (appointed vs. hereditary)
- Full mechanics of House Granger's official recognition
- Whether other Muggle-borns can found Noble Houses

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't assume all powerful wizarding families are Noble Houses - some may be wealthy/influential without title
- Don't forget blood debt law is formal legal framework with specific procedures
- Don't ignore that Voldemort created blood purity ideology cynically, not sincerely
- Don't make House Potter "Most Ancient" - text only calls it "Noble House" [Ch. 17]
- Don't assume Noble Houses all support blood purity - Bones and Longbottom oppose Malfoy
- Don't forget Hermione founds House Granger - unprecedented for Muggle-born

**Useful for Stories**:
- Political intrigue via Wizengamot and Noble House alliances
- Blood debt plots requiring legal maneuvering
- Class conflict between Noble Houses and other wizards
- Hermione navigating her new role as Noble House founder
- Board of Governors as Hogwarts power center
- Economic power dynamics (Malfoy wealth, Potter inheritance)
