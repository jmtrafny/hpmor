# Time-Turners - Time Travel Rules

## Overview

Time-Turners are magical devices that allow the user to travel backwards in time, creating stable time loops with consistent causality. Unlike typical fictional time travel, HPMOR Time-Turners operate under strict constraints that prevent paradoxes through **enforced consistency** - you cannot change the past because the past already includes everything you will do when you travel back to it.

## Established Rules [EXPLICIT]

### Basic Constraints

1. **Six-Hour Maximum Limit** [Ch. 14]
   - "The Time-Turner cannot be used to move more than six hours backwards" [Ch. 14]
   - "It can't be used more than six times in any day" [Ch. 14]
   - This appears to be a physical constraint of the device, not an artificial limitation
   - The restriction is mentioned on shell that protects the hourglass

2. **No Paradoxes - Universe Enforces Consistency** [Ch. 14, 17, 61]
   - "Oh, you can't change time!" [Ch. 14]
   - The universe is self-consistent - you can only do things that you already did
   - If you go back in time, the timeline already includes your future-self's actions
   - There is only ONE timeline, not branching timelines

3. **Information Consistency** [Ch. 17]
   - "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" [Ch. 17]
   - Harry tried to use Time-Turner to solve NP-complete problems (factoring large primes)
   - The universe prevented him from creating an inconsistent loop
   - Result: "To the best of Harry's knowledge, that had been the scariest experimental result in the entire history of science" [Ch. 17]

### Practical Rules & Warnings

4. **Avoid Meeting Your Past Self** [Ch. 14]
   - "Wizards are advised to avoid being seen by their past selves" [Ch. 14]
   - If you must cross paths: "the first version of you should step aside and close his eyes at a known time...so that the future you can pass" [Ch. 14]
   - Violation consequence: "I understand that it can be quite disconcerting" [Ch. 14]
   - Does NOT destroy the universe, but is psychologically disturbing

5. **Fragility and Protection** [Ch. 14]
   - Time-Turners "can be fragile" [Ch. 14]
   - "I do think I've heard about strange things happening if they're broken" [Ch. 14]
   - Harry's suggestion: "Perhaps you ought to provide your time machines with some sort of protective shell, rather than leaving the glass exposed" [Ch. 14]
   - McGonagall agrees this is "an excellent idea" - implying wizards had never thought of it

6. **Information Cannot Pass Certain Barriers** [Ch. 61]
   - Information from Azkaban's future cannot reach its past through Time-Turners
   - This prevents certain types of temporal loops involving Azkaban
   - "Azkaban's future cannot touch its past" [Ch. 61]
   - This appears to be a special property of Azkaban's protections

### How Information Flows Through Time

7. **Stable Time Loops Only** [Ch. 14, 17]
   - Any action you take when going back MUST be consistent with what already happened
   - Example: Harry pranked himself before he knew about Time-Turners [Ch. 14]
   - The prank only "closed the loop" - future-Harry did what past-Harry already experienced
   - "It was clear once you saw it from the outside" [Ch. 14]

8. **Cause and Effect Run Backwards** [Ch. 14]
   - "The spell doesn't force funny events to happen, it just makes you feel an impulse to drink right before funny things are going to happen anyway!" [Ch. 14]
   - "Drinking the Comed-Tea doesn't cause the comedy, the comedy causes you to drink the Comed-Tea!" [Ch. 14]
   - "All makes sense once you draw the causal arrows going backwards in time!" [Ch. 14]
   - This is how Comed-Tea works - backwards causation

### Paradox Resolution

9. **What Happens When You Try to Create a Paradox?** [Ch. 17]
   - The universe will prevent you from creating inconsistent loops
   - Harry's experiment: Set up algorithm where only stable loop is one containing prime factors
   - Result: Message saying "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" appeared instead
   - Implication: The universe found a different stable solution than the one Harry intended
   - The mechanism of enforcement is unknown and possibly unknowable

10. **You Cannot Use Time-Turners for Computation** [Ch. 17]
    - Harry tried to make the universe solve NP-complete problems for him
    - The universe refused - it found a consistent loop that didn't include the answer
    - This suggests intelligence or some selection mechanism for which stable loops occur
    - "How that particular stable time loop had been selected out of what was, in retrospect, a rather large space of possibilities" remained a mystery [Ch. 17]

## Known Limitations [EXPLICIT]

### What Time-Turners CANNOT Do

1. **Cannot Change Observed Events** [Ch. 14, 61]
   - If something has been observed to happen, it WILL happen
   - You cannot go back and prevent something you already know occurred
   - Attempting to do so will fail in some consistent way

2. **Cannot Create Information From Nothing** [Ch. 17]
   - The "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" experiment proved this
   - You cannot use time loops to gain knowledge not available in the timeline
   - Stable loops will form that avoid information creation

3. **Cannot Bypass the Six-Hour Limit** [Ch. 14, 61]
   - No matter how many times you turn it, you can't go back more than six hours
   - Shell/protective restriction appears unbreakable (though tampering is theoretically possible)
   - Dumbledore's detection charms found no tampering on Harry's Time-Turner [Ch. 61]

4. **Cannot Interact With Certain Protected Locations** [Ch. 61]
   - Azkaban's past and future are isolated from each other via Time-Turner
   - Attempting to send information across this barrier results in paradox
   - Other locations may have similar protections (unknown)

### Investigation Complications

5. **Time-Turner Cases Are Extremely Difficult** [Ch. 61]
   - "Only one Auror in thirty was qualified to investigate cases involving Time-Turners" [Ch. 61]
   - "Of those few, the half who weren't already insane, soon would be" [Ch. 61]
   - Story of time-criminal vs. time-Auror both ending up in St. Mungo's "ward for Total Unrecoverable Nutcases" [Ch. 61]
   - Determining what happened when multiple Time-Turners interact is incredibly complex

6. **Diagrams Required for Complex Scenarios** [Ch. 61]
   - When Dumbledore and Snape discuss Time-Turner scenarios: "I think we must draw diagrams for this" [Ch. 61]
   - Even brilliant wizards cannot reason about complex time loops without visual aids
   - Conclusion after extensive analysis: "We know nothing" [Ch. 61]

## How It Works [INFERRED]

### The "Consistent Histories" Model

Time-Turners appear to operate under a "consistent histories" or "Novikov self-consistency principle" model:

1. **There is only ONE timeline** - no branching, no alternate universes
2. **The timeline must be self-consistent** - no contradictions allowed
3. **When you go back in time, you were ALREADY there** - your actions are already part of history
4. **The universe "selects" a consistent loop** from all possible consistent options

### The Deep Mystery

Harry realizes that Time-Turners reveal something profound about the universe [Ch. 14]:

- **Time doesn't work by acyclic causal networks**
- Normal cause-and-effect assumes causes come before effects
- Time-Turners allow effects to come before causes
- This means reality cannot be described by standard models of causation
- Quote: "A Turing machine could simulate going back into a defined moment of the past and computing a different future from there, an oracle machine could rely on the halting behaviour of lower-order machines, but what you're saying is that reality somehow self-consistently computes in one sweep using information that hasn't...happened...yet..." [Ch. 14]

### Human Comprehension Limits

Harry confronts a terrifying possibility [Ch. 14]:

- His brain is made of "old-fashioned linear-time neurons"
- Time-Turner causality may be fundamentally incomprehensible to human minds
- "There was nothing his brain could do, no operation it could perform, which was conjugate to the operation of a Time-Turner" [Ch. 14]
- First time Harry encounters a potentially **permanently mysterious** phenomenon
- Challenges his belief that "a mysterious answer was a contradiction in terms"

## Edge Cases & Ambiguities [AMBIGUOUS]

### Unresolved Questions

1. **How does the universe "choose" which stable loop occurs?**
   - Many possible self-consistent loops could exist
   - Which one actualizes, and why?
   - Does the selection process have intelligence? Randomness? Optimization criteria?

2. **What happens if you deliberately try to create a paradox?**
   - We know the universe will stop you somehow
   - But HOW? Do you lose free will? Does something physically prevent you?
   - Does attempting paradoxes damage the Time-Turner or reality itself?

3. **Can Time-Turner restrictions be overcome?**
   - Six-hour limit seems fundamental, but could the device be modified?
   - Shell tampering is mentioned as theoretically possible [Ch. 61]
   - Voldemort or other powerful wizards might have methods

4. **What is Azkaban's temporal isolation mechanism?**
   - Why can't Time-Turner information cross Azkaban's boundary?
   - Is this property unique to Azkaban?
   - Could other locations be similarly protected?

5. **Do prophecies interact with Time-Turners?**
   - Prophecies predict the future
   - Time-Turners connect to the past
   - What happens when prophecy meets time travel?

6. **What are the "strange things" that happen when Time-Turners break?**
   - McGonagall mentions hearing about this [Ch. 14]
   - No specifics given
   - Could be catastrophic or merely inconvenient

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't treat Time-Turners as "fix anything" devices**
   - You cannot change events that already happened
   - You can only do what you already did
   - Characters who time-travel should discover they were always part of events, not changing them

2. **Don't create grandfather paradoxes**
   - The universe simply won't allow it
   - If you write a scene where someone tries, show it failing in a consistent way
   - The "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" experiment is your template

3. **Don't forget the psychological toll**
   - Meeting yourself is "disconcerting"
   - Thinking about time loops drives Aurors insane
   - Characters should struggle with the implications

4. **Don't ignore the six-hour limit**
   - This is a hard constraint in HPMOR
   - Don't hand-wave it away without very good reason
   - If you bypass it, explain how and at what cost

### What You Can Do

1. **Exploit stable time loops for clever plotting**
   - Information from the future influencing the past (like Comed-Tea)
   - Characters receiving help from their future selves
   - Mysteries where the solution involves recognizing a stable loop

2. **Explore the horror of predestination**
   - If you go back, you already went back
   - Do you have free will when executing a time loop?
   - Psychological impact of knowing you "must" do something

3. **Use Time-Turners for dramatic irony**
   - Readers can know about the future-self's actions before the character does
   - Build tension around how the loop will close
   - Foreshadow events that will be caused by time travel

4. **Investigate the selection mechanism**
   - Why does one stable loop happen instead of another?
   - Could this be manipulated or exploited?
   - What are the "rules" for which loop gets selected?

### What's Open to Interpretation

1. **Exact mechanism of consistency enforcement**
   - HOW does the universe prevent paradoxes?
   - This is deliberately left mysterious in HPMOR
   - You can speculate, but don't claim to have the definitive answer

2. **Limits of what's "already determined"**
   - When you decide to use a Time-Turner, how much is fixed?
   - Where is the boundary between free will and predetermined action?
   - Philosophy playground here

3. **Other Time-Turner restrictions**
   - Are there other protective measures like Azkaban's?
   - Could certain spells or wards block Time-Turner use?
   - Unexplored territory

4. **Multiple Time-Turner interactions**
   - What happens when several people use Time-Turners in the same area?
   - Can loops nest inside loops?
   - Very complex - even HPMOR doesn't fully explore this
