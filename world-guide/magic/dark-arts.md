# Dark Arts - Horcruxes, Unforgivables, Dark Magic

## Overview

The Dark Arts in HPMOR encompass a range of magic considered evil or dangerous, from the Unforgivable Curses to Horcruxes and sacrificial rituals. Most importantly, Voldemort fundamentally improved the Horcrux spell, creating a new form of immortality that requires "over one hundred" murders but makes him nearly unkillable [Ch. 108]. The Killing Curse and other dark magic follow strict, unbreakable rules that make them particularly dangerous weapons.

## Established Rules [EXPLICIT]

### The Killing Curse (Avada Kedavra)

1. **Unblockable and Unstoppable** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108, throughout]
   - "There is a certain spell which is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every single time on anything with a brain" [Ch. 108]
   - Cannot be shielded against by normal magical defenses
   - No counter-curse exists
   - Works on any living thing with a brain

2. **Requires Intent to Kill** [IMPLIED] [Ch. 45, 108]
   - You must genuinely want the target dead
   - "The universe actually did want you to say 'Wingardium Leviosa'" applies to all spells [Ch. 22]
   - Killing Curse likely requires genuine killing intent to function
   - Voldemort can cast it freely because he genuinely doesn't value others' lives

3. **Leaves No Physical Trace** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - "Killing Curses do not ruin houses or leave burnt bodies behind them" [Ch. 108]
   - Clean, instant death
   - This is why everyone mistakenly thinks Harry survived a Killing Curse
   - Voldemort actually used a different spell (Horcrux-creation ritual) on baby Harry

4. **Can Be Taught** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 43]
   - Quirrell won a wager with Dumbledore allowing him to teach it [Ch. 43]
   - "I am allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who wish to learn it" [Ch. 43]
   - Quirrell's argument: "Which will render them considerably safer from Dark Wizards and other pests" [Ch. 43]
   - "It is foolish to think they will otherwise know no deadly magics" [Ch. 43]

### Horcruxes - The Traditional Spell

5. **Basic Horcrux Mechanics** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - Creates an "anchor" to the world that prevents true death
   - Requires murdering someone
   - If your body is destroyed, you become a "disembodied spirit"
   - Can only possess victims who physically contact the Horcrux object
   - The spirit is weak and diminished

6. **Fundamental Flaw of Traditional Horcruxes** [Ch. 108]
   - Young Tom Riddle: "Made myself a horcrux as a certain book had shown me, using the death of Abigail Myrtle beneath the eyes of Slytherin's basilisk" [Ch. 108]
   - "I planned to make a new horcrux every year after I left Hogwarts" [Ch. 108]
   - But the spell was deeply flawed - you're trapped, weak, dependent on chance discovery
   - "Imbuing them into ancient lockets, instead of anonymous pebbles; guarding them beneath wells of poison in the centre of a lake of Inferi, instead of portkeying them into the sea" [Ch. 108]
   - Young Voldemort's Horcruxes were "the hopeless idiocy of my youth" [Ch. 108]

### Voldemort's Improved Horcrux System [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]

7. **The Perfected Immortality Spell** [Ch. 108]
   - "I rewove it and remade it, and devised a new ritual based on new principles" [Ch. 108]
   - "An invented sacrificial ritual, based on a principle untested by all known magic" [Ch. 108]
   - "I still use the word 'horcrux', but only from sentiment. It is a new thing entirely, the greatest of all my creations" [Ch. 108]
   - Voldemort spent years perfecting it in imagination before attempting it

8. **Physical Anchors Still Exist** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - "There are still physical anchors for your immortality" [Ch. 108]
   - Voldemort confirms in Parseltongue: "Your guess is right, boy, for all the good it does you" [Ch. 108]
   - But they're hidden beyond any possible recovery:
     - One in an active volcano, sinking into Earth's mantle
     - One buried kilometers down in anonymous cubic meter of Earth's crust
     - One dropped into Mariana Trench
     - One floating high in stratosphere, transparent
     - One is the Pioneer 11 plaque (possibly both Pioneer probes)
   - "Fire, earth, water, air, void" [Ch. 108]

9. **Obliviated Locations** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - "Even you don't know where they are, because you Obliviated the exact details from your memory" [Ch. 108]
   - Voldemort cannot reveal their locations even under truth potion or Legilimency
   - "All five are beyond my reach, or yours" [Ch. 108]

10. **Over 100 Horcruxes** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - Harry: "How many anchors did you make?" [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort: "Answer is that I do not know. Stopped counting somewhere around one hundred and seven. Simply made a habit of it each time I murdered someone in private" [Ch. 108]
    - This is vastly more than traditional Horcruxes (one or a few)
    - Destroying the five known locations would NOT kill him

11. **Still Requires Human Murder** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - "Your immortality spell still requires a human death? Why?" [Ch. 108]
    - "Great creation maintains life and magic within devices created by sacrificing life and magic of others" [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort: "Liked false description of previous horcrux spell so much, so disappointed when realised truth of it, thoughts of improved version came out in that shape" [Ch. 108]
    - Even the perfected version requires killing people

12. **Can Return Without Contacting Horcrux** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - Original flaw: "I would only be able to enter a victim who contacted the physical horcrux" [Ch. 108]
    - This left him trapped for 9+ years after Godric's Hollow
    - But: "Thanks to you, I learned where to find the Resurrection Stone" [Ch. 108]
    - "I have now incorporated it into my great creation" [Ch. 108]
    - Now his "spirit can fly where it pleases and seduce the most opportune victim" [Ch. 108]

13. **Rapid Resurrection** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - "I shall return swiftly, if this body is killed. Will be greatly annoyed, and vengeful" [Ch. 108]
    - No longer needs to wait for someone to find a Horcrux
    - Can possess anyone vulnerable or willing
    - "I set horcruxes in better places at once, and now even that is unnecessary" [Ch. 108]

### The Resurrection Stone

14. **Not True Resurrection** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - "The Resurrection Stone does not bring back the dead, of course" [Ch. 108]
    - "But it holds a more ancient magic than my own for projecting the seeming of a spirit" [Ch. 108]
    - "Since I am one who has defeated death, Cadmus's Hallow acknowledged me its master, and answered all my will" [Ch. 108]
    - Allows Voldemort's spirit to manifest and possess without needing Horcrux contact
    - This is "a catastrophe for any who oppose me" [Ch. 108]

### Other Dark Magic

15. **Dementors** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 45]
    - "Wounds in the world" - manifestations of Death itself [Ch. 45]
    - Cannot be killed by normal means: "There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell...a spell of cursed fire. It is what you would use to destroy an ancient device such as the Sorting Hat. It has no effect on Dementors" [Ch. 45]
    - "They are undying" (traditional belief) [Ch. 45]
    - "Attacking a wound only makes it larger" [Ch. 45]
    - However, True Patronus CAN destroy them [Ch. 45]

16. **Dementor's Kiss** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 43]
    - "Some books claimed the Dementor's Kiss would eat your soul" [Ch. 43]
    - Results in "permanent mindless coma" [Ch. 43]
    - Used as execution method by wizarding government
    - Harry is horrified that they would use this even if souls existed
    - May not literally destroy the soul, but the effect is permanent brain death

17. **Fiendfyre (Cursed Fire)** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 45, 108]
    - "A certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell...a spell of cursed fire" [Ch. 45]
    - "What you would use to destroy an ancient device such as the Sorting Hat" [Ch. 45]
    - Can destroy magical artifacts that are otherwise indestructible
    - "No effect on Dementors" [Ch. 45]
    - A Fiendfyre phoenix appears in Ch. 108

18. **Memory Charms and Obliviation** [EXPLICIT] [Throughout]
    - Can completely erase specific memories
    - Can implant false memories
    - Hermione was Obliviated and given False Memory Charms [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort Obliviated his own knowledge of Horcrux locations [Ch. 108]
    - Extensive use constitutes dark magic when used for manipulation

19. **Imperius Curse** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - Allows complete control of victim
    - Victim acts on caster's will
    - Can be used to create chains: "Imperius some of the stronger wizards who could Imperius others" [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort chose not to use this to conquer Ministry (for complex strategic reasons)
    - Lucius Malfoy falsely accused of Imperiusing Professor Sprout in one of Quirrell's plots [Ch. 108]

20. **Cruciatus Curse** [EXPLICIT] [Throughout]
    - Torture curse causing intense pain
    - "I did not have to suppress my impulse to Cruciate people being idiots; for once it was all part of the role" [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort uses it freely as Lord Voldemort persona
    - Long-term exposure can cause permanent insanity (Longbottoms)

### Sacrificial Magic

21. **Lily Potter's Sacrifice** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 85, 89, 108]
    - Voldemort to Lily: "Very well, I accept the bargain. Yourself to die, and the child to live. Now drop your wand so that I can murder you" [Ch. 108]
    - This was a deliberate ritual setup by Voldemort
    - He was trying to make Harry into a Horcrux using the old spell
    - The sacrifice had real magical power
    - Protected Harry in some way (though not as canon suggests)

22. **Ritual Requirements** [INFERRED] [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort's improved Horcrux is "an invented sacrificial ritual" [Ch. 108]
    - Requires precise intention and understanding
    - Voldemort "kept that ritual burning in my mind for years, perfecting it in imagination, pondering its meaning and making fine adjustments, waiting for the intention to stabilise" [Ch. 108]
    - "At last I dared to invoke my ritual" [Ch. 108]
    - Inventing new rituals is incredibly dangerous and requires deep magical understanding

## The Godric's Hollow Disaster [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]

### What Actually Happened

23. **Voldemort's Original Plan** [Ch. 108]
    - Trelawney's prophecy: someone would be his equal
    - Voldemort wanted an intelligent equal to talk to after "fifty years of being surrounded by gibbering stupidity" [Ch. 108]
    - Plan: "Mark the baby as my equal by casting the old horcrux spell in such fashion as to imprint my own spirit onto the baby's blank slate" [Ch. 108]
    - "It would be a purer copy of myself, since there would be no old self to mix with the new" [Ch. 108]
    - The two Tom Riddles would "play the game against each other forever, keeping our lives interesting amid a world of fools" [Ch. 108]

24. **Magical Resonance** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - "The resonance in our magic. When I had shaped the baby's spirit to be like my own..." [Ch. 108]
    - The resonance mirrors what happens when Harry's Patronus collides with Quirrell's Killing Curse
    - "Burning, tearing agony in his forehead, like his head had been about to split in half" [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort tried to control the chaotic fluctuations instead of changing to Animagus form
    - "That was the wrong decision, and I failed" [Ch. 108]

25. **The Result** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - "My body was destroyed, even as I overwrote the infant Harry Potter's mind; each of us destroying all but a remnant of the other" [Ch. 108]
    - This gave Harry his dark side - remnants of Tom Riddle's mind
    - Voldemort's spirit fled to his Horcruxes
    - The house was destroyed by the magical explosion
    - Everyone thought the Killing Curse had rebounded (it hadn't)

26. **Why Everyone Is Wrong About the Killing Curse** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
    - "Everyone thinks the Boy-Who-Lived is somehow immune to the Killing Curse" [Ch. 108]
    - "Even though Killing Curses do not ruin houses or leave burnt bodies behind them" [Ch. 108]
    - "Because it has not occurred to them that Lord Voldemort would ever use any other spell" [Ch. 108]
    - The truth: Voldemort used the Horcrux ritual, not Avada Kedavra
    - But the evidence doesn't fit Killing Curse effects - nobody noticed this

## Known Limitations [EXPLICIT]

### What Dark Magic CANNOT Do

1. **Cannot Kill Dementors (Traditionally)** [Ch. 45]
   - Even Fiendfyre doesn't work
   - "Wounds in the world" cannot be destroyed by attacking them
   - Only the True Patronus (affirming life) can destroy them

2. **Horcruxes Don't Prevent All Harm** [IMPLIED]
   - Quirrell's body can still be killed
   - He'll return, but annoyed and vengeful
   - Temporary disruption is possible even if not permanent death

3. **Cannot Create More Philosopher's Stones** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - Only one Stone exists
   - Nicholas Flamel's "alchemical recipe" is "another lie" [Ch. 108]
   - The real Stone was stolen from Baba Yaga by Perenelle [Ch. 108]
   - No known method to manufacture more

4. **Resurrection Stone Doesn't Truly Resurrect** [Ch. 108]
   - Projects "seeming of a spirit" only
   - Cannot bring back the actually dead
   - For Voldemort it's useful for his own spirit, not for raising others

### Costs and Consequences

5. **Requires Human Deaths** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - Each Horcrux requires a murder
   - Voldemort committed "over 107" murders for his Horcruxes
   - This is an unavoidable cost even of the improved system

6. **Social/Legal Consequences** [EXPLICIT]
   - Unforgivable Curses carry automatic Azkaban sentence
   - Using them marks you as Dark Wizard
   - Creates political enemies and risks Ministry opposition
   - Though Voldemort notes this didn't matter much given Ministry incompetence

7. **Magical Resonance Danger** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - If two people have "resonance in their magic," certain spells become dangerous
   - Harry and Quirrell have this resonance
   - Caused the Godric's Hollow disaster
   - Prevents Quirrell from using Killing Curse on Harry

## Edge Cases & Ambiguities [AMBIGUOUS]

### Unresolved Questions

1. **What exactly is the "principle untested by all known magic" in Voldemort's improved Horcrux?**
   - He won't explain it: "Denied" [Ch. 108]
   - Some fundamental magical principle he discovered
   - Allows multiple Horcruxes without the traditional spell's weaknesses

2. **Could someone else learn to make improved Horcruxes?**
   - Voldemort says he thought to teach Harry "when you were older" [Ch. 108]
   - But "I have changed my mind" [Ch. 108]
   - Theoretically possible but requires genius-level magical innovation

3. **How does magical resonance work?**
   - Caused by making Harry's spirit "like my own" [Ch. 108]
   - Prevents certain magical interactions
   - Not fully explained

4. **What other dark rituals exist?**
   - Voldemort mentions "all the Darkest Arts I could find" [Ch. 108]
   - "All the interdicted secrets to which Slytherin's Monster gave me keys" [Ch. 108]
   - Implies vast body of forbidden knowledge

5. **Can you invent entirely new dark spells?**
   - Voldemort invented his improved Horcrux ritual
   - Suggests yes, but requires extraordinary skill and knowledge
   - Extremely dangerous - could fail catastrophically

6. **What makes magic "dark"?**
   - Is it intent? Effect? Specific techniques?
   - Killing Curse requires genuine intent to kill
   - But is that what makes it dark, or just how it works?

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't assume Horcruxes work like canon**
   - HPMOR Horcruxes are radically different
   - Voldemort made over 100, not 7
   - The improved version is nearly unbeatable
   - Cannot be destroyed by normal means (they're hidden impossibly well)

2. **Don't forget the Killing Curse is truly unblockable**
   - No shield works
   - No counter-curse exists
   - "Works every single time on anything with a brain" [Ch. 108]
   - Only way to avoid it is not being hit (dodge, or be behind solid cover)

3. **Don't trivialize the costs of dark magic**
   - Each Horcrux requires a murder
   - Over 100 murders for Voldemort's immortality
   - This should have psychological and moral weight
   - Even Voldemort notes it's not pleasant, just necessary for his goals

4. **Don't ignore Voldemort's intelligence**
   - He spent years perfecting his ritual in imagination
   - He understands magic at a fundamental level
   - He's not cartoonishly evil - he has reasons (however wrong) for everything
   - He learns from mistakes (though he has blind spots)

### What You Can Do

1. **Explore the implications of 100+ Horcruxes**
   - How do you fight someone who's made that many?
   - What does it mean to murder 100+ people?
   - Can they be traced? Detected? Counted?

2. **Use the unblockable nature of Killing Curse**
   - Forces different combat tactics
   - Can't just shield and tank it
   - Must dodge, use cover, prevent line of sight
   - Creates interesting tactical scenarios

3. **Play with magical innovation**
   - Voldemort invented a new ritual
   - Could other characters invent new magic?
   - What would it take? What could go wrong?

4. **Examine the ethics**
   - Is Voldemort right that death is wrong and should be defeated?
   - If so, does that justify the means?
   - Where's the line between acceptable and unacceptable costs?

### What's Open to Interpretation

1. **Details of other dark rituals**
   - What did Voldemort learn from Slytherin's secrets?
   - What other dark magic exists in HPMOR?
   - How do they work?

2. **Whether Voldemort could be convinced to stop killing**
   - He's not sadistic - he kills for strategic reasons
   - Could he be persuaded to find non-murderous alternatives?
   - Or is murder too integrated into his magic now?

3. **The exact mechanism of Horcrux creation**
   - What makes the improved version work?
   - How does it differ mechanically from the old version?
   - Could it be reverse-engineered?

4. **Limits of magical resonance**
   - What other effects does it have beyond preventing Killing Curse?
   - Could it be exploited or used beneficially?
   - Can it be broken or overcome?
