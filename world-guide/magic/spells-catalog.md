## Notes for Fanfiction Writers

### Spell Invention and Discovery

1. **New spells can be invented** [Ch. 108]
   - Voldemort invented his improved Horcrux spell
   - Harry discovered partial Transfiguration
   - Both required deep understanding, not just following instructions

2. **The Interdict of Merlin prevents written transmission of powerful magic** [Ch. 23, 25]
   - You cannot learn powerful spells from books
   - Knowledge must pass person-to-person
   - This means many ancient spells have been lost forever

3. **Pronunciation and technique matter absolutely** [Ch. 22]
   - Spells are "buttons, not blueprints"
   - Exact pronunciation required (e.g., "Wingardium Leviosa")
   - Slight variations can cause complete failure or altered effects

4. **Intent and understanding affect capability** [Ch. 22, 28]
   - You need some understanding of what spell does
   - Belief matters for accessing magic, not for defining effects
   - Mental models can enable or prevent certain techniques (e.g., partial Transfiguration)

### Common Fanfiction Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't make spell invention trivial**
   - Voldemort spent years perfecting his improved Horcrux
   - Harry needed quantum mechanics to achieve partial Transfiguration
   - New spells should be rare and require genuine insight

2. **Don't forget spell limitations**
   - Transfigurations are temporary
   - Shields don't block everything
   - Even powerful spells have counters or weaknesses

3. **Don't ignore the Interdict**
   - Characters can't just read powerful spells in old books
   - Lost knowledge is genuinely lost
   - Living teachers are essential for advanced magic

4. **Don't make Unforgivable Curses too easy**
   - "You really have to mean it"
   - Killing Curse requires genuine killing intent
   - Not every wizard can cast them effectively
