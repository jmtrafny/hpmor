# Fundamental Rules of Magic

## Overview

Magic in HPMOR operates under strict, consistent rules that differ significantly from canon Harry Potter. The most important discovery: magic is not a natural phenomenon emerging from genetic complexity, but rather an **engineered system** created by an advanced civilization (likely Atlantis) that responds to specific DNA markers and precisely-defined triggers. Magic functions more like compiled software than natural law.

## Established Rules [EXPLICIT]

### The Source of Magic

1. **Magic is Externally Sourced** [Ch. 22-25]
   - "Magic came from somewhere else." [Ch. 22]
   - DNA does not directly create magical abilities through protein chains
   - A particular DNA sequence acts as a "marker" that the Source of Magic recognizes
   - The Source pays attention to this marker among "ordinary ape-descended humans in every other way" [Ch. 22]

2. **Magic is Engineered, Not Evolved** [Ch. 22]
   - "Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of Magic, and told it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker." [Ch. 22]
   - Magic shows "purposefulness" and goal-orientation
   - Spells are "purposefully complicated, but not...complicated for the purpose of making copies of themselves"
   - Magic serves the user, like a car, not itself, like a butterfly

3. **The Atlantis Connection** [INFERRED] [Ch. 22, 25]
   - Ancient civilization (possibly Atlantis) likely created the Source of Magic
   - The Interdict of Merlin suggests knowledge was deliberately restricted after some catastrophe [Ch. 25]
   - "Atlantis" is referenced but little concrete information survives

### Spell Mechanics: Words and Gestures as Triggers

4. **Spells Are Buttons, Not Blueprints** [Ch. 22, 25]
   - "The words and wand movements were just triggers, levers pulled on some hidden and more complex machine. Buttons, not blueprints." [Ch. 22]
   - You MUST say spells exactly right or they fail completely
   - Example: "Oogely boogely" with vowel duration ratio of 3:1:2 creates a glowing bat; 3:1:1 creates a non-glowing bat; 3:2:1 creates a crippled bat [Ch. 22]
   - "The universe actually DID want you to say 'Wingardium Leviosa' and it wanted you to say it in a certain exact way and it didn't care what you thought the pronunciation should be" [Ch. 22]

5. **Belief and Intent Matter** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 22]
   - If you don't know what a spell is supposed to do at all, it won't work
   - If you have completely wrong information about what it should do, it won't work
   - If you have vague or partially wrong information, the spell works as originally designed, NOT as you expect
   - This is NOT the same as "belief makes it real" - the spell has objective requirements

6. **Free Transfiguration Requires Mental Separation** [Ch. 28]
   - Wordless Transfiguration requires "complete mental separation between the concept of form and concept of material" [Ch. 22]
   - You must think of form and substance as entirely separate concepts
   - This is why it's considered advanced magic

### Conservation and Effort

7. **Magic Requires Effort Proportional to Task Difficulty** [Ch. 22, 28]
   - Casting spells is tiring, especially if they fail repeatedly
   - More powerful or complex effects require more magical energy/effort
   - "Failed Transfiguration was almost as tiring as successful Transfiguration" [Ch. 28]

8. **Magical Energy in Potions** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 78]
   - "Conservation of energy applies to magic too" [Ch. 78]
   - Example: Storing sunlight in acorns and releasing it as bright purple light [Ch. 78]
   - Energy must come from somewhere and go somewhere

### Transfiguration Constraints

9. **You Cannot Transfigure Whole Objects Only** [EXPLICIT - later broken] [Ch. 28]
   - Traditional teaching: You must Transfigure entire objects, not parts
   - You cannot Transfigure half a match into a needle
   - **This is actually a conceptual limitation, not a true law** [Ch. 28-29]
   - Harry later overcomes this limitation through partial Transfiguration (see transfiguration.md)

10. **Transfiguration Safety Rules** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 28]
    - "I will never Transfigure anything into liquid or gas" [Ch. 28]
    - "I will never Transfigure anything that looks like food or anything else that goes inside a human body" [Ch. 28]
    - These rules exist for good reasons - violating them can be lethal

11. **Transfigurations Are Temporary** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 28, 108]
    - Normal Transfigurations last for a limited time, then revert
    - Duration depends on the caster's power and the complexity
    - The Philosopher's Stone can make Transfigurations permanent [Ch. 108]
    - "Conjurations such as the castle Hogwarts are maintained by a constant well of magic" [Ch. 108]

### What Magic CANNOT Do

12. **You Cannot Transfigure Things That Don't Exist Yet** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 28]
    - Harry and Hermione tried to Transfigure an Alzheimer's cure - failed [Ch. 28]
    - You can only Transfigure substances that exist and are known
    - Harry tried to Transfigure nanotechnology "a la Eric Drexler" - failed [Ch. 28]
    - **Critical limitation**: You cannot create genuinely novel molecular structures through Transfiguration

13. **Transfiguration Doesn't Add Enchantments** [Ch. 28]
    - "Transfiguration, at least the kind they could do, didn't enchant the targets"
    - You can't Transfigure a regular broomstick into a flying one
    - The magical properties are separate from the physical form

14. **Living Things Cannot Be Transfigured (Safely)** [IMPLIED] [Ch. 57-58]
    - "Other living weapons cannot be Transfigured; they will not survive the disenchantment" [Ch. 108]
    - Mountain trolls can be Transfigured, but this is noted as unusual/dangerous
    - Six-hour Time-Turner limit matters for Transfiguration traces [Ch. 108]

### Magic and Science

15. **Magic Violates Known Physics** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 22, 28]
    - "Conventional physics seemed quite capable of describing amino acids, and no matter how many amino acids you chained together, conventional physics said you would never, ever get magic out of it" [Ch. 22]
    - Broomsticks operate on **Aristotelian physics**, not Newtonian physics [Ch. 59]
    - This is one of the most dangerous discoveries Harry makes

16. **Magic Does Not Obey Normal Causality** [IMPLIED] [Multiple]
    - Time-Turners create closed time loops [Ch. 14, 17]
    - Information cannot be created or destroyed in time travel
    - Prophecies and divination suggest some form of acausal knowledge

## Known Limitations [EXPLICIT]

### What Wizards Cannot Do

1. **Cannot Make More Philosopher's Stones** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - Only one Stone exists (created/stolen by Perenelle/Baba Yaga)
   - Nicholas Flamel's "alchemical recipe" is a deliberate lie [Ch. 108]
   - The Stone's "one and only power" is "imposition of permanency" [Ch. 108]
   - No known method exists to create another

2. **Cannot Kill Dementors (Traditionally)** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 45]
   - "There is a certain extremely dangerous and destructive spell...a spell of cursed fire. It is what you would use to destroy an ancient device such as the Sorting Hat. It has no effect on Dementors." [Ch. 45]
   - Dementors are "wounds in the world" [Ch. 45]
   - "Attacking a wound only makes it larger" [Ch. 45]
   - **However**: Harry later develops the True Patronus which CAN destroy Dementors [Ch. 45]

3. **Cannot Resurrect the Dead (Traditionally)** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108-111]
   - The Resurrection Stone does not actually bring back the dead [Ch. 108]
   - It "holds a more ancient magic...for projecting the seeming of a spirit" [Ch. 108]
   - True resurrection requires the Philosopher's Stone or other advanced magic
   - Bodies must be preserved to prevent information loss [Ch. 90]

4. **Cannot Create True Immortality (Easily)** [EXPLICIT] [Ch. 108]
   - Traditional Horcruxes have severe limitations (see dark-arts.md)
   - Voldemort's improved version requires "simply making a habit of it each time I murdered someone in private" [Ch. 108]
   - Over 107 murders required before he stopped counting [Ch. 108]
   - Each anchor requires a human death [Ch. 108]

## How It Works [INFERRED]

### The "Magic as Compiled Software" Model

Harry's best working theory [Ch. 22, 25]:

1. **Ancient Atlanteans** (or similar) created an artificial system - the Source of Magic
2. **DNA markers** act as authentication - "who is allowed to use this system"
3. **Spell words/gestures** are like API calls or function names in programming
4. **The Source** does the actual work of manipulating reality
5. **Intent and understanding** act as parameters or context for the API call

This explains why:
- Pronunciation must be exact (like spelling in code)
- Belief matters but doesn't override the spell's true function (understanding API documentation)
- You can't just make up new spells easily (you can't add functions to compiled software)
- Complex effects happen from simple triggers (the actual computation happens server-side)

### Why This Matters

Understanding magic as an engineered system rather than a natural phenomenon has profound implications:

- **Magic can potentially be hacked or reverse-engineered**
- **There may be undocumented features or exploits**
- **The system might have been designed with specific goals or constraints**
- **Understanding the underlying implementation could allow bypassing normal limitations**

Harry's partial Transfiguration [Ch. 28-29] is the first example of this kind of "hacking" - finding a workaround to an artificial limitation.

## Edge Cases & Ambiguities [AMBIGUOUS]

### Unresolved Questions

1. **How did Atlantis create the Source of Magic?**
   - No information available
   - May be impossible to discover given the Interdict of Merlin [Ch. 25]

2. **Can the Source of Magic be modified or controlled?**
   - Unknown
   - If it could be, it would be catastrophically dangerous [Ch. 95]

3. **What are the true limits of Transfiguration?**
   - Partial Transfiguration broke one "absolute" rule [Ch. 28-29]
   - What other "rules" are actually just conceptual limitations?
   - Can you Transfigure air if you truly understand it as atoms? [Ch. 28]

4. **Why does magic recognize certain DNA sequences?**
   - The genetic pattern is "Mendelian" (simple inheritance) [Ch. 22-25]
   - This suggests a single marker, not complex genetic machinery
   - But why this particular sequence?

5. **Can Muggle-borns exist if magic is genetic?**
   - Yes, they can [EXPLICIT throughout]
   - This proves the magical "gene" is simple, not complex interdependent machinery [Ch. 22]
   - Complex adaptations must be universal in a species; simple markers can reappear

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't treat magic as mystical or belief-based**
   - HPMOR magic has consistent, objective rules
   - Belief matters for accessing your magic, not for defining what magic can do
   - The universe doesn't care about your intentions if you pronounce the spell wrong

2. **Don't assume wizards understand their own magic**
   - Most wizards never question the system
   - They accept limitations as absolute that may be conceptual
   - "Wizards couldn't transform parts of things" was WRONG [Ch. 28-29]

3. **Don't forget the Atlantis angle**
   - Magic was created, not evolved
   - This means it has PURPOSE and DESIGN
   - Someone chose what magic could and couldn't do

4. **Don't ignore conservation principles**
   - Magic has costs (effort, energy, components)
   - Effects have to come from somewhere
   - "Free energy" machines probably don't exist even in magic

### What You Can Do

1. **Exploit conceptual limitations**
   - If a "rule" is really just how wizards think about magic, it can be broken
   - Partial Transfiguration is the template for this kind of innovation
   - Ask: "Is this a law of magic, or a law of wizard psychology?"

2. **Explore the engineering angle**
   - Magic as designed system opens many story possibilities
   - Hidden features, deprecated functions, security vulnerabilities
   - Maybe someone can find the "admin console"

3. **Test edge cases**
   - What if you said a spell in Parseltongue instead of English?
   - What if you used a wand made of different materials?
   - What if you tried casting through a Time-Turner effect?

4. **Work within conservation**
   - More powerful magic should have higher costs
   - Resources should matter (ingredients, energy, time)
   - Tradeoffs make for better stories than "infinite power"

### What's Open to Interpretation

1. **The exact nature of the Source of Magic**
   - How does it work? Where is it? Can it be found?
   - This is deliberately left mysterious in HPMOR

2. **What other "absolute" rules are actually conceptual?**
   - Harry broke partial Transfiguration
   - What else might be possible with the right mental model?

3. **The limits of magical innovation**
   - How much can you hack the system before it breaks?
   - Are there safety limits built in?
   - Can you create truly NEW spells, or only discover existing ones?

4. **Interactions between magic and advanced technology**
   - Nanotechnology + Transfiguration didn't work [Ch. 28]
   - But what about other combinations?
