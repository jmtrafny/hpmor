# Backstory: Pre-Hogwarts Timeline

## Overview

HPMOR's backstory spans from ancient Atlantis to Harry's childhood in Oxford. Key events include Merlin's Interdict, Grindelwald's defeat, Voldemort's rise and fall (1970-1981), and Harry's adoption by the Verres family - a major divergence from canon where Petunia married scientist Michael Verres instead of Vernon Dursley.

## Ancient History

### Atlantis [EXPLICIT Ch. 108]

**Details**: HPMOR doesn't elaborate on Grindelwald war specifics beyond Dumbledore's victory

## First Wizarding War (1970-1981)

### Voldemort's Origins [EXPLICIT Ch. 108]

**Tom Riddle's Transformation**:
- Riddle planned to become "heroic" David Monroe
- First created "practice identity" to learn Dark Lord tactics
- "Dark Lord with glowing red eyes, pointlessly cruel to his underlings, pursuing a political agenda of naked personal ambition combined with blood purism as argued by drunks in Knockturn Alley" [Ch. 108]

**Death Eater Formation**: [Ch. 108]
- "My first underlings were hired in a tavern, given cloaks and skull masks, and told to introduce themselves as Death Eaters"
- Started as disposable practice organization
- "Eventually you realized you were just having more fun as Voldemort" [Ch. 108]
- Voldemort persona became primary identity

### The Terror (Approximately 1970-1981) [Ch. 3]

**Voldemort's Campaign**:
- "Raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives" [Ch. 3]
- Death Eaters wielded "wealth...political power...and secrets held in blackmail, to paralyse a society trying to protect itself" [Ch. 3]

**Terror Tactics - Example: Yermy Wibble** [Ch. 3]:
- "Old and respected journalist" called for increased taxes and conscription
- "Shouted that it was absurd for the many to cower in fear of the few"
- His skin and skins of wife and two daughters "found nailed to the newsroom wall that next morning"
- Message: "Whoever stood out the most became the next example"

**International Response**: [Ch. 3]
- "Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene"
- Fear: "Whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror"
- "Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first" [Ch. 3]

**Resistance**:
- Aurors fought Death Eaters: "My grandson was an Auror. Died in seventy-nine" [Ch. 3]
- Individual heroes opposed Voldemort
- Dumbledore's faction resisted politically
- **No Order of the Phoenix mentioned** (major canon divergence)
- Resistance largely uncoordinated [IMPLIED]

**Duration**: Approximately 11 years before Voldemort's defeat

### October 31, 1981: Voldemort's Defeat [EXPLICIT Ch. 1, 3, 108]

**Prophecy and Targeting**:
- Voldemort targeted Potter family based on prophecy
- "October 31st, 1981. It was the most important day in the history of the world" [Ch. 1]

**Immediate Aftermath**:
- Death Eaters scattered

- **Sirius Black imprisoned without trial**: "Junior Minister in charge when the Aurors arrested Black was none other than Cornelius Fudge" [Ch. 29]
- **Bellatrix Black** attacked Longbottoms: "Tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom into insanity because she wanted to find out what happened to the Dark Lord" [Ch. 27]

**Significance**:
- Ended First Wizarding War
- Harry became Boy-Who-Lived
- Voldemort believed dead (actually survived as spirit)

## Key Divergences from Canon

**Major Changes**:
1. **Petunia marries Michael Verres, not Vernon Dursley** [Ch. 1]
2. **Harry raised in loving, scientific household** [Ch. 1]
3. **No Order of the Phoenix** (never mentioned)
4. **Voldemort created Death Eaters as "practice identity"** [Ch. 108]
5. **Interdict of Merlin detailed as plot point** [Ch. 23]

**Retained from Canon**:
- October 31, 1981 attack at Godric's Hollow
- James and Lily's deaths
- Harry survives with scar
- Voldemort's body destroyed
- Death Eaters scattered/imprisoned
- Bellatrix tortured Longbottoms
- Sirius imprisoned (though without trial)
- Grindelwald defeated by Dumbledore

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Harry raised by Verres family in Oxford, not Dursleys
- Petunia transformed personality to impress Michael Verres
- Voldemort created Death Eaters as practice/experiment
- Interdict prevents powerful spells from being written down
- First War lasted approximately 11 years (1970-1981)
- No Order of Phoenix organized resistance
- Sirius imprisoned without trial by Junior Minister Fudge
- Bellatrix tortured Longbottoms seeking Voldemort info

**What's Open to Interpretation** [AMBIGUOUS]:
- Exact timeline of Voldemort's rise
- Details of Grindelwald war
- Harry's specific childhood experiences in Oxford
- How Petunia and Michael met exactly
- Why Dumbledore allowed Verres adoption vs. forcing Dursley placement
- Other prophecy details beyond targeting Potter family

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't give Harry abusive childhood - raised lovingly by Verres family
- Don't include Order of Phoenix - never mentioned in HPMOR
- Don't make Voldemort sincere blood purist - he created ideology cynically
- Don't forget Interdict prevents writing powerful spells
- Don't assume Sirius had trial - explicitly imprisoned without one
- Don't make Petunia canon's bitter character - she's transformed in HPMOR

**Useful for Stories**:
- Harry's scientific upbringing as character foundation
- Verres family dynamics and flashbacks
- Bellatrix's desperate search for Voldemort after 1981
- Sirius's unjust imprisonment subplot
- Interdict of Merlin as limitation on magical knowledge
- Voldemort's practice identity revelation
- First War terror tactics and their lasting impact
