# Ethical Frameworks - Consequentialism, Heroic Responsibility, and Moral Philosophy

## Overview

HPMOR explores complex ethical questions through Harry's **consequentialist** framework (outcomes matter more than intentions), contrasted with Dumbledore's deontological approach (certain acts are inherently right/wrong regardless of consequences) and Quirrell's amoral pursuit of power [Throughout]. The story doesn't preach simple morality—it examines hard trade-offs, conflicting values, and the difficulty of doing good in a complex world [Ch. 39, 60, 79-84, 85, 120-122].

## Consequentialism [EXPLICIT]

### Outcomes Matter More Than Intentions [Throughout]

1. **The Core Principle** [IMPLIED throughout]
   - **Definition**: Action's morality determined by its consequences, not intentions or inherent rightness
   - **Harry's view**: Saving lives is good; failing to save lives is bad, regardless of why
   - **Contrast with deontology**: Some acts might be "wrong" in themselves but right if they save more lives
   - **Application**: Harry willing to break rules, lie, manipulate if it saves people

2. **Utilitarian Calculations** [Ch. 48, 82-84]
   - **Principle**: Maximize total good (usually happiness, life, welfare)
   - **Example**: Should you sacrifice one person to save five? Utilitarian says yes
   - **Harry's approach**: Tries to calculate expected value of actions
   - **Quote**: "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few." [Ch. 48]
   - **Complication**: Harry can't always follow pure utilitarianism (loves Hermione more than strangers)

3. **"Heroic Responsibility"** [Ch. 85]
   - **Definition**: If you could have prevented something bad, you bear some responsibility for it happening
   - **Quote**: Chapter 85 discusses constrained optimization under moral responsibility
   - **Application**: Harry feels responsible for Hermione's death because he could have saved her (if he'd been faster, smarter, better prepared)
   - **Extension**: Responsible for all preventable suffering you have power to prevent
   - **Limit**: Can't save everyone; must prioritize, but that doesn't remove responsibility

4. **Intentions Don't Matter (Much)** [IMPLIED throughout]
   - **Standard view**: "I meant well" excuses bad outcomes
   - **Harry's view**: Good intentions + bad outcomes = you failed; do better
   - **Example**: Dumbledore's manipulation "for the greater good" → Harry judges by RESULTS, not intentions
   - **Caveat**: Intentions matter for predicting future behavior, but don't excuse past harm

### Problems with Pure Consequentialism [IMPLIED Ch. 79-84, 89-90]

5. **Can't Always Calculate Consequences** [Ch. 79-84]
   - **Problem**: Real world is complex; can't predict all outcomes
   - **Example**: Saving Hermione from Azkaban → led to her death by troll (unintended consequence)
   - **Implication**: Must use heuristics, best guesses, uncertainty management
   - **Harry's approach**: Calculate expected value under uncertainty (Bayesian)

6. **Humans Aren't Perfectly Utilitarian** [Ch. 82-84, 89-90]
   - **Observation**: Harry values Hermione more than strangers (not utilitarian)
   - **Justification**: Humans need special connections; pure utilitarianism psychologically impossible
   - **Middle ground**: Mostly consequentialist, but allow for personal relationships
   - **Quote**: "If I were the first person in the universe who ever really cared about someone else, which I'm not by the way, then I'd be honoured to be that person." [Ch. 95]

7. **Some Acts Feel Wrong Even If Consequentially Good** [IMPLIED Ch. 79-84]
   - **Example**: Torturing one person to save a thousand?
   - **Utilitarian answer**: Yes, do it
   - **Human intuition**: That's wrong, don't do it
   - **Harry's struggle**: Intellectually consequentialist, emotionally deontological sometimes
   - **Resolution**: Incomplete in story; Harry still figuring this out

## Key Ethical Positions [EXPLICIT]

### Death is the Enemy [Ch. 39, 45, 96]

8. **Absolute Rejection of Death** [Ch. 39, 45]
   - **Position**: Death is bad, not natural or acceptable
   - **Quote**: "Death is not something I will ever embrace. It is only a childish thing, that the human species has not yet outgrown." [Ch. 39]
   - **Implication**: Fighting death is moral imperative
   - **Contrast**: Dumbledore accepts death as natural; Harry rejects this completely
   - **Foundation**: If death is enemy, defeating it is highest good

9. **Death Gives Meaning to Life?** - REJECTED [Ch. 39]
   - **Common view**: Death makes life precious because it's finite
   - **Harry's response**: No, LIVING gives meaning to life; death just ends it
   - **Counter-argument**: People with longer lives appreciate life MORE, not less
   - **Conclusion**: Death is pure negative; no upside

10. **The Potter Family Quest** [Ch. 96]
    - **Quote**: "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" (gravestone)
    - **Position**: Multi-generational commitment to defeating death
    - **Harry's acceptance**: "I accept my family's quest. Death is my enemy, and I will defeat it." [Ch. 96]
    - **Implication**: This is central moral mission, outweighs other concerns

### Heroic Responsibility [Ch. 85, throughout]

11. **If You Could Save Someone, Their Death Is On You** [Ch. 85]
    - **Principle**: Don't hide behind "not my job" or "someone else will handle it"
    - **Application**: Hermione died → Harry could have saved her → Harry failed → Harry responsible
    - **Extension**: Anyone suffering you could prevent → you bear responsibility
    - **Problem**: Can't save everyone, so must prioritize → but still responsible for those you don't save

12. **No Bystander Effect** [IMPLIED throughout]
    - **Standard**: "Someone else will help, not my problem"
    - **Harry's view**: If you CAN help, you SHOULD help
    - **Quote**: "Someone has to do something, and why not me?" [implied throughout]
    - **Application**: Can't ignore suffering just because others could also act

13. **Obligation to Optimize** [Throughout]
    - **Principle**: Not enough to "help"; must help OPTIMALLY
    - **Example**: Giving money to moderately effective charity when highly effective charity exists → wasting potential good
    - **Application**: Harry doesn't just save Hermione; he tries to save her in way that costs least/accomplishes most
    - **Limit**: Perfect optimization impossible; "good enough" sometimes acceptable

### Everyone's Life Has Equal Value [IMPLIED Ch. 45, 82-84]

14. **No Person More Valuable Than Another** [Ch. 45, 82-84]
    - **Principle**: All human lives equally valuable (in abstract)
    - **Quote**: "Some day the descendants of humanity will spread from star to star" [Ch. 45] - all humanity matters
    - **Application**: Wizard vs. Muggle, British vs. foreign, friend vs. stranger - all equally valuable
    - **Complication**: Harry DOES value Hermione more than strangers (humans aren't perfectly utilitarian)

15. **Scope Sensitivity** [IMPLIED Ch. 45, 82-84]
    - **Principle**: Should care proportionally to number affected
    - **Problem**: Humans bad at this (1000 deaths doesn't feel 100x worse than 10 deaths)
    - **Harry's approach**: Train yourself to feel appropriate concern for scope
    - **Application**: Saving Hermione matters, but saving ALL OF HUMANITY from death matters vastly more

### Breaking Rules When Necessary [Throughout]

16. **Rules Are Heuristics, Not Absolutes** [Throughout]
    - **Position**: Rules usually good, but not sacred
    - **Example**: "Don't break into Azkaban" → good rule generally, but override it to save innocent
    - **Harry's approach**: Break rules when expected value of breaking > following
    - **Caveat**: Must account for systemic effects (if everyone broke rules, chaos)

17. **Deontological Rules as Useful Heuristics** [IMPLIED throughout]
    - **Recognition**: "Don't lie," "don't steal," "don't kill" are usually good
    - **Why**: Consequences usually bad if you violate them
    - **When to override**: When you're confident consequences of breaking rule are better
    - **Example**: Lying to Death Eaters to save innocent = good (consequences outweigh rule)

### "Do Not Destroy What You Cannot Repair" [IMPLIED Ch. 90]

18. **Reversal Principle** [Ch. 90, throughout]
    - **Principle**: Don't cause irreversible harm unless necessary
    - **Application**: Death is irreversible (or was, until Harry resurrects Hermione) → avoid causing death
    - **Example**: Harry preserves Hermione's body → ensures resurrection possible
    - **Contrast**: Quirrell kills Bahry without hesitation → irreversible harm for convenience
    - **Implication**: Consequentialism with constraint - prefer reversible actions when possible

## Ethical Dilemmas in Story [EXPLICIT]

### Hermione's Trial (Truth vs. Consequences) [Ch. 79-84]

19. **Should Harry Tell Truth or Save Hermione?** [Ch. 79-84]
    - **Situation**: Hermione falsely accused of attempted murder; will go to Azkaban
    - **Option 1**: Tell truth (she's innocent, frame-up) → probably fails, Hermione goes to Azkaban
    - **Option 2**: Buy her freedom (spend Potter fortune) → succeeds, Hermione saved, but injustice unpunished
    - **Harry's choice**: Option 2 - save Hermione, deal with injustice later
    - **Reasoning**: Consequences (Hermione in Azkaban) worse than moral cost (spending money, not exposing conspiracy immediately)

20. **Justice vs. Mercy** [Ch. 79-84]
    - **Justice**: Expose conspiracy, punish guilty, clear innocent's name
    - **Mercy**: Save innocent from suffering, even at cost of justice
    - **Harry's choice**: Mercy first, justice later (if possible)
    - **Implication**: Saving person from suffering > abstract principle of justice

### Using Time-Turner for Rescue [Ch. 61, 89]

21. **Should Harry Use Time-Turner to Save Hermione?** [Ch. 89]
    - **Situation**: Hermione killed by troll; Time-Turner could potentially save her
    - **Problem**: Time-Turner rules prevent changing what already happened
    - **Option 1**: Try to use Time-Turner → probably fails due to consistency rules
    - **Option 2**: Don't try → Hermione stays dead
    - **Harry's choice**: Doesn't use Time-Turner (understands it won't work due to consistency)
    - **Alternative**: Preserve body, pursue resurrection instead

22. **Time Travel Ethics** [Ch. 17, 61]
    - **Question**: If you can change past, should you?
    - **HPMOR answer**: You can't (magic enforces consistency)
    - **Implication**: No time-travel ethical dilemmas (physics prevents them)

### Final Confrontation Choices [Ch. 113-115]

23. **Harry vs. Voldemort Under Constraints** [Ch. 113-115]
    - **Situation**: Voldemort has Harry at wandpoint, 36+ Death Eaters present, Hermione hostage
    - **Constraint**: Must win without Time-Turner, without wand, without help
    - **Harry's approach**: Use rationality, preparation, Muggle technology
    - **Ethical question**: Kill all Death Eaters to save self/Hermione/world?
    - **Harry's choice**: Yes - consequentialist calculation favors killing them (they'd kill many more if left alive)
    - **Method**: Transfigured nanowire through ground, resonance with Voldemort's magic, kills all Death Eaters nearly instantly

24. **Killing as Self-Defense** [Ch. 113-115]
    - **Question**: Is it okay to kill in self-defense or defense of others?
    - **Harry's position**: Yes, when no better option exists
    - **Application**: Kills troll to save Hermione (or tries to) [Ch. 89]
    - **Application**: Kills Death Eaters to save self/Hermione/world [Ch. 113-115]
    - **Principle**: Consequentialist - their lives vs. potential victims' lives → kill attackers

## Contrasts: Harry vs. Other Characters [EXPLICIT]

### Harry vs. Dumbledore on Death [Ch. 39]

25. **Acceptance vs. Rejection**
    - **Dumbledore**: "It is not a sad thing, that we must die—"
    - **Harry**: "Yes it is!"
    - **Dumbledore's view**: Death is natural teacher, transition, release
    - **Harry's view**: Death is enemy to be defeated
    - **Result**: Fundamental philosophical divide

### Harry vs. Quirrell on Power and Morality [Ch. 60, 95, 108]

26. **Consequentialism vs. Amorality**
    - **Harry**: Outcomes matter; saving lives good, causing suffering bad
    - **Quirrell**: Power matters; morality is weakness, sentiment clouds judgment
    - **Harry**: "Everyone's life has value"
    - **Quirrell**: "People are expendable means to ends"
    - **Result**: Harry willing to use harsh means but only for good ends; Quirrell has no moral constraints

### Consequentialism vs. Virtue Ethics [IMPLIED throughout]

27. **What Makes Action Good?**
    - **Consequentialism (Harry)**: Action good if produces good outcomes
    - **Virtue ethics (partially Dumbledore)**: Action good if reflects virtuous character
    - **Example**: Lying to save someone
      - Consequentialist: Good (saves life)
      - Virtue ethics: Bad (dishonest character)
    - **Harry's position**: Mostly consequentialist, but recognizes virtue matters for character formation

### Deontology vs. Consequentialism [Ch. 79-84, throughout]

28. **Rules vs. Outcomes**
    - **Deontological**: Some acts inherently right/wrong regardless of consequences
      - "Don't lie" (even if lying would save life)
      - "Don't kill innocent" (even if killing one saves many)
    - **Consequentialist (Harry)**: Act determined by outcomes
      - Lie if it saves life
      - Kill one to save many (if no better option)
    - **Middle ground**: Harry uses deontological rules as heuristics but overrides them when consequences clearly favor it

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

### What's Established

- **Harry is consequentialist**: Judges actions by outcomes [EXPLICIT]
- **Death is the enemy**: Central moral position [EXPLICIT]
- **Heroic responsibility**: If you can prevent bad outcome, you bear responsibility [EXPLICIT]
- **Breaking rules acceptable**: When consequences justify it [EXPLICIT]
- **Everyone's life has equal value**: In principle (if not emotional practice) [IMPLIED]
- **Harry will kill to save others**: Shown with troll, Death Eaters [EXPLICIT]

### What's Open to Interpretation [AMBIGUOUS]

- **Limits of heroic responsibility**: How much must Harry sacrifice?
- **Pure utilitarianism vs. personal relationships**: Where's the balance?
- **Which rules can be broken**: Where are the lines?
- **Long-term ethics**: How does Harry's philosophy evolve?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Harry as deontologist**: He's NOT a "follow the rules" character
2. **Harry accepting death**: Never happens; central to character
3. **Harry as amoral**: He cares deeply about outcomes, suffering, welfare
4. **Simple good vs. evil**: HPMOR explores complex ethical trade-offs
5. **Dumbledore as wise**: Harry sees him as flawed, manipulative (even if well-intentioned)
6. **Ignoring consequences**: Actions in HPMOR have consequences; track them

### How to Write Harry's Ethics

**Do**:
- Have him calculate expected outcomes
- Show him willing to break rules for good outcomes
- Make him struggle with hard trade-offs
- Demonstrate heroic responsibility (taking blame for preventable bad outcomes)
- Show tension between utilitarian logic and human emotions

**Don't**:
- Make ethics simple or preachy
- Have him follow rules blindly
- Ignore consequences of actions
- Forget he's human (can't be perfectly utilitarian)
- Make him amoral or cynical (he cares deeply)

### Story Hooks Writers Can Explore

- **Ethical dilemmas with no good answer**: Force Harry to choose between bad options
- **Heroic responsibility taken too far**: What if Harry blames himself for everything?
- **Consequentialism vs. personal relationships**: Hermione vs. a thousand strangers?
- **Teaching ethics to others**: Can Harry explain his framework to Hermione, Draco?
- **Long-term consequences**: Actions that seem good short-term, bad long-term (or vice versa)
- **Moral luck**: When Harry's gambles pay off vs. fail
