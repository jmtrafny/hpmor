# Rationality Concepts - Cognitive Biases and Rational Thinking

## Overview

HPMOR is fundamentally a story about **rationality**—the art of thinking clearly, updating beliefs based on evidence, and winning in reality [Throughout]. Harry teaches rationality concepts to other characters (especially Draco), applies them to magical problems, and the story itself demonstrates these principles through plot and character decisions. This file catalogs the specific cognitive biases mentioned, rationality techniques used, and key concepts that drive the narrative.

## Cognitive Biases Mentioned [EXPLICIT]

### Fundamental Attribution Error [Ch. 1, 5]

1. **Definition**: Tendency to attribute others' behavior to their character while attributing your own behavior to circumstances.
   - **Chapter**: Ch. 5 (title of chapter)
   - **Example in story**: Harry realizes people explain Petunia's rejection of magic as "she's just cruel" when reality is more complex—she lost her sister and felt abandoned.
   - **Quote**: "People don't think about their true rejection." [Ch. 5]
   - **Application**: Understanding why people actually do things (not just dismissing them as "bad/stupid") leads to better predictions and solutions.

### Confirmation Bias [Ch. 8, throughout]

2. **Definition**: Seeking evidence that confirms your beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence.
   - **Chapter**: Ch. 8 (Positive Bias - variant of confirmation bias)
   - **Example in story**: Harry teaches Draco about designing experiments where results prove one hypothesis OR another, not just confirming what you already believe.
   - **Quote**: "The way to show someone else is to perform an experiment where the result comes out one way if I'm right, and another way if you're right." [Ch. 8]
   - **Application**: Design experiments that could prove you WRONG, not just right.

### Planning Fallacy [Ch. 6]

3. **Definition**: Tendency to underestimate how long tasks will take and how many things can go wrong.
   - **Chapter**: Ch. 6 (title of chapter)
   - **Example in story**: Harry plans his magical experiments and preparations, aware that things will take longer than expected.
   - **Quote**: "If you wanted to test something, you had to hold the right things constant." [Ch. 6]
   - **Application**: Add buffers, expect complications, plan for things going wrong.

### Availability Bias [IMPLIED throughout]

4. **Definition**: Overestimating likelihood of events that easily come to mind (dramatic, recent, or emotionally vivid).
   - **Example in story**: Wizards overestimate danger of Dementors (vivid, terrifying) while underestimating danger of Azkaban policy (abstract, systemic).
   - **Application**: Check actual statistics/evidence, not just what feels scary or dramatic.

### Hindsight Bias [IMPLIED throughout]

5. **Definition**: After learning outcome, believing you "knew it all along."
   - **Example in story**: After major plot reveals, Harry checks whether he genuinely could have predicted them or just feels like he should have.
   - **Application**: Distinguish between "I predicted this" and "this seems obvious now that I know it."

### Sunk Cost Fallacy [IMPLIED Ch. 60, 82-84]

6. **Definition**: Continuing investment because of past costs, even when cutting losses would be better.
   - **Example in story**: Harry doesn't fall for this—willing to abandon plans when evidence suggests they won't work, even after significant investment.
   - **Counter-example**: Some characters continue failed approaches because they've "already committed so much."
   - **Application**: Past costs are GONE. Only consider future costs and benefits.

### Scope Insensitivity [IMPLIED Ch. 45, 82-84]

7. **Definition**: Difficulty grasping differences between large numbers (1000 deaths vs 10,000 deaths feels similar).
   - **Example in story**: Harry recognizes that saving Hermione matters, but saving EVERYONE from death matters more—scales his emotional response to actual scope.
   - **Application**: Train yourself to feel proportional concern for proportional problems.

### Bystander Effect / Diffusion of Responsibility [IMPLIED throughout]

8. **Definition**: When many people could help, each assumes someone else will do it, so no one does.
   - **Example in story**: Harry rejects this—if he CAN help, he SHOULD help, regardless of others.
   - **Heroic responsibility**: If you could have prevented something, it's partially your responsibility [Ch. 85]
   - **Application**: Don't wait for someone else. If you can help, help.

## Rationality Techniques [EXPLICIT]

### Bayesian Reasoning [Ch. 20, throughout]

9. **Update on Evidence** [Ch. 20]
   - **Concept**: Beliefs should have strength proportional to evidence
   - **Quote**: "The strength of a belief should be proportional to the evidence." [Ch. 20]
   - **Bayes' Theorem**: Formal mathematical way to update probability estimates
   - **Application in story**: Harry constantly updates beliefs as new evidence arrives
   - **Example**: Initially skeptical of magic → sees evidence → updates to high confidence magic is real [Ch. 1]

10. **Prior Probability** [Ch. 49]
    - **Concept**: Your starting estimate before new evidence
    - **Chapter**: Ch. 49 (Prior Information)
    - **Quote**: "Your priors matter more than you think." [Ch. 49]
    - **Application**: Recognize what assumptions you're starting with; extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence

11. **Conservation of Expected Evidence** [IMPLIED throughout]
    - **Concept**: Learning that you WILL receive evidence can't change your current probability estimate
    - **Example**: If you know you'll test something tomorrow, you can't increase confidence today just from knowing test will happen
    - **Application**: Don't count your chickens before they hatch; evidence only counts once you actually have it

### Hypothesis Testing [Ch. 7-8, throughout]

12. **Controlled Experiments** [Ch. 7-8]
    - **Concept**: Change one variable, hold others constant, measure result
    - **Quote**: "If you wanted to test something, you had to hold the right things constant." [Ch. 6]
    - **Application in story**: Harry designs experiments to test magical hypotheses
    - **Example**: Testing whether blood purity affects magical power (would need controlled experiment)

13. **Null Hypothesis** [IMPLIED Ch. 22-23]
    - **Concept**: Default assumption is "no effect" until evidence proves otherwise
    - **Application**: Don't believe claims without evidence; burden of proof on person making claim
    - **Example**: Draco claims Muggle-borns are weaker → null hypothesis is "no difference" → needs evidence to reject null

### Noticing Confusion [Ch. 1, throughout]

14. **Confusion as Signal** [Ch. 1, throughout]
    - **Concept**: If something doesn't make sense, that's important information—reality is consistent
    - **Quote**: "When you're confused, you're supposed to ask questions." [Ch. 1]
    - **Application**: Don't ignore confusion; it means your model is wrong somewhere
    - **Example**: Harry confused how magic can exist → investigates rather than ignoring confusion
    - **Another example**: "Something about the Bellatrix mission doesn't add up" → Harry investigates

15. **Fake Explanations** [Ch. 1, throughout]
    - **Concept**: Explanation that sounds good but doesn't actually predict anything
    - **Example**: "It's magic" isn't an explanation—it's a curiosity-stopper
    - **Quote**: "Saying 'magic' doesn't make me understand any better what's going on." [implied throughout]
    - **Application**: Reject mysterious answers; demand actual understanding

### Reductionism [Ch. 22-23, 28-29]

16. **Understanding Components** [Ch. 22-23]
    - **Concept**: Complex things are made of simpler parts; understanding parts helps understand whole
    - **Application in story**: Partial Transfiguration works because Harry thinks of objects as atoms, not "whole things"
    - **Quote**: Objects aren't fundamental—atoms are [implied Ch. 22]
    - **Example**: "Desk" is concept; reality is atoms arranged desk-wise

17. **Explain Like I'm Five** [IMPLIED throughout]
    - **Concept**: If you can't explain something simply, you don't understand it
    - **Application**: Harry often explains complex ideas to others, forcing clear understanding
    - **Example**: Teaching Draco scientific method requires Harry to articulate it clearly

### Scientific Method [Ch. 1, 7-8, 22-23]

18. **Observation → Hypothesis → Prediction → Test → Update** [Ch. 1, throughout]
    - **Classic scientific method applied to magic**
    - **Example cycle**:
      - Observe: Magic seems to exist
      - Hypothesis: Magic follows consistent rules
      - Prediction: Same spell should work repeatably
      - Test: Try spell multiple times
      - Update: Refine understanding of spell based on results

19. **Replication** [IMPLIED Ch. 22-23]
    - **Concept**: Results should be reproducible by others
    - **Application**: Harry's partial Transfiguration should work for others (if they understand physics)
    - **Limits**: Interdict of Merlin prevents full replication of powerful magic

## Key Rationality Concepts [EXPLICIT]

### "Rationalists Should Win" [Throughout]

20. **Winning in Reality** [Implicit throughout, explicit in rationalist community]
    - **Concept**: If your "rationality" doesn't help you succeed in real world, you're doing it wrong
    - **Quote**: "What good is it to know the name of a bird in Martian if you don't know what it does?" [paraphrased]
    - **Application in story**:
      - Harry's rationality helps him save Hermione (spends fortune) [Ch. 82-84]
      - Helps him survive Voldemort (thinks clearly under pressure) [Ch. 113-115]
      - Helps him achieve goals (resurrect Hermione) [Ch. 122]
    - **Counter-example**: Rationality that makes you feel smart but doesn't help you achieve goals is fake rationality

### Epistemic vs. Instrumental Rationality [IMPLIED throughout]

21. **Two Types of Rationality**
    - **Epistemic**: Having accurate beliefs (map matches territory)
    - **Instrumental**: Achieving your goals (winning)
    - **Both necessary**: Accurate beliefs help achieve goals; achieving goals helps test beliefs
    - **Application**: Harry values truth (epistemic) AND accomplishing things (instrumental)

### Map vs. Territory [IMPLIED throughout]

22. **The Map is Not the Territory**
    - **Concept**: Your beliefs (map) are not the same as reality (territory)
    - **Map can be wrong**: Update map when it doesn't match territory
    - **Don't confuse them**: "I believe X" ≠ "X is true"
    - **Application**: Harry constantly checks whether his understanding (map) matches observations (territory)

### Privileging the Hypothesis [IMPLIED throughout]

23. **Don't Privilege Your Hypothesis**
    - **Concept**: Don't give special attention to one possibility just because you thought of it first
    - **Example**: "Dumbledore is good because he's Dumbledore" privileges that hypothesis
    - **Application**: Consider ALL reasonable hypotheses with equal initial weight
    - **Harry's approach**: Generates multiple explanations, weighs evidence for each

### Heroic Responsibility [Ch. 85]

24. **If You Could Have Prevented It, You're Responsible** [Ch. 85]
    - **Concept**: Don't hide behind "it's not my job" or "someone else will handle it"
    - **Quote**: Chapter 85 title is "Taboo Tradeoffs, Constrained Optimization"—heroic responsibility discussed
    - **Application**: If Hermione dies and Harry could have saved her, it's on him
    - **Extension**: If people suffer from Azkaban and Harry could stop it, it's on him
    - **Limit**: Must balance against other responsibilities; can't save everyone always

### Shut Up and Multiply [IMPLIED Ch. 45, 82-84]

25. **Math Beats Intuition for Large Numbers**
    - **Concept**: Calculate expected value; don't rely on gut feeling
    - **Application**: One friend's life vs. thousand strangers' lives → math says save thousand (even if gut says save friend)
    - **Harry's struggle**: Emotionally driven to save Hermione; rationally knows he should optimize for most lives saved
    - **Resolution**: Saves Hermione because he actually values her more (humans aren't perfectly utilitarian, and that's okay within limits)

## Quotes: Harry's Explanations [EXPLICIT]

### On Updating Beliefs

26. **"I'm going to make some embarrassing mistakes, but that happens when you're doing something new and difficult that nobody's ever done before."** [Ch. 1]
    - Context: Harry accepting he'll be wrong sometimes
    - Lesson: Mistakes are normal when exploring; don't let fear of being wrong stop you

27. **"Don't believe everything you think."** [IMPLIED throughout]
    - Context: Meta-cognitive awareness
    - Lesson: Your thoughts/beliefs can be wrong; question them

### On Evidence and Proof

28. **"The first virtue is curiosity."** [Ch. 1]
    - Context: Harry's approach to magic
    - Lesson: Start by wanting to know, not wanting to confirm existing beliefs

29. **"If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves... That's what the experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve things just by arguing."** [Ch. 1]
    - Context: Arguing with McGonagall about magic's existence
    - Lesson: Empirical tests beat verbal arguments

### On Understanding

30. **"Saying 'magic' doesn't explain anything."** [IMPLIED throughout]
    - Context: Rejecting fake explanations
    - Lesson: Labels aren't explanations; need actual causal mechanisms

31. **"How do I know what I know?"** [Throughout]
    - Context: Meta-level questioning
    - Lesson: Trace beliefs back to evidence; know why you believe things

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

### What's Established

- **Harry is rationalist**: Core character trait, not optional [EXPLICIT]
- **Specific biases named**: Fundamental attribution error, confirmation bias, planning fallacy [EXPLICIT]
- **Bayesian reasoning**: How Harry updates beliefs [EXPLICIT]
- **Scientific method**: Applied to magic systematically [EXPLICIT]
- **"Notice confusion" as technique**: Key to Harry's success [EXPLICIT]
- **Heroic responsibility**: If you can help, you should [EXPLICIT]

### What's Open to Interpretation [AMBIGUOUS]

- **Which other biases Harry knows**: List not exhaustive
- **How much rationality can be taught**: Can Draco become as rational as Harry?
- **Limits of rationality**: Where does it fail? When are emotions better?
- **Rationality in other characters**: Who else uses these techniques?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Harry not being rational**: If Harry doesn't think rationally, he's out of character
2. **Rationality as superpower**: Harry still makes mistakes, has blindspots
3. **Ignoring emotions**: Harry feels deeply; rationality doesn't mean emotionless
4. **Explaining concepts poorly**: Harry can articulate these ideas clearly
5. **Other characters too rational**: Most wizards DON'T think this way; contrast matters
6. **Rationality solves everything**: Some problems are hard even with clear thinking

### How to Write Rational Harry

**Do**:
- Have him notice confusion and investigate
- Update beliefs when evidence contradicts them
- Design experiments to test hypotheses
- Explain his reasoning clearly when teaching others
- Make mistakes, then learn from them
- Feel emotions but think clearly about them

**Don't**:
- Make him ignore evidence
- Have him commit obvious cognitive biases without noticing
- Make him give up on understanding things
- Write him as purely logical robot
- Forget he's still 11 years old (brilliant 11-year-old, but still a kid)
