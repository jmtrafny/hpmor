# Hogwarts Geography

## Overview

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a massive magical castle in Scotland with "moving staircases, floors," numerous secret passages, and grounds including the Forbidden Forest, Quidditch pitch, and a lake [throughout].

## HPMOR vs Canon Differences

**Retained from Canon**:
- General castle structure (Great Hall, common rooms, dormitories)
- Four House tables in Great Hall
- Moving staircases and complex layout
- Forbidden Forest and grounds
- Hospital Wing, library, classrooms
- Third-floor corridor as forbidden area

**HPMOR Specific/Emphasized**:
- **Explicit navigational difficulty**: Escher painting comparison [Ch. 13]
- **Wards detect injuries**: Specific mechanics of ward triggering [Ch. 79]
- **Lake used for army battles**: Non-canon use of grounds [Ch. 29-30]
- **Trophy room as duel location**: Specific plot location [Ch. 79]
- **Air-Freshening Charm needed in common room**: Humorous detail [Ch. 21]
- **Dumbledore's "Permitted Forest" joke**: Rationalist humor [Ch. 12]

**Less Detailed Than Canon**:
- Room of Requirement: Not mentioned in HPMOR
- Specific secret passages: Not catalogued
- Detailed common room entrances: Not described
- Chamber of Secrets: Not mentioned
- Most classroom locations: Not specified

## Key Scenes

- **Ch. 9**: Sorting ceremony in Great Hall
- **Ch. 12**: Dumbledore's announcements about Forbidden Forest and third-floor corridor
- **Ch. 13**: Harry navigates confusing halls looking for Slytherin dungeons
- **Ch. 21**: Ravenclaw common room packed for Harry-Hermione reading contest

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Hogwarts layout is genuinely confusing (Escher painting comparison)
- Great Hall serves as central gathering space
- Wards detect sudden injuries but can be circumvented
- Lake large enough for combat scenarios
- Trophy room accessible to students
- Common rooms have specific atmospheres (Ravenclaw: bookshelves, intellectual)

**What's Open to Interpretation** [AMBIGUOUS]:
- Exact layout of castle beyond mentioned locations
- Specific routes between areas
- Most secret passages
- Room of Requirement existence/location
- Detailed common room entrance mechanisms
- Full extent of Hogwarts wards and protections

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't assume easy navigation - HPMOR emphasizes complexity
- Don't forget wards can detect Dark magic and injuries
- Don't include Room of Requirement without noting it's not mentioned in HPMOR
- Don't make Hogwarts smaller/simpler than portrayed
- Don't ignore that slow-acting curses can evade ward detection

**Useful for Stories**:
- Complex castle layout for mystery/chase scenes
- Common rooms as House-specific social spaces
- Wards as both protection and plot constraint
- Great Hall for public confrontations/announcements
- Lake and grounds for outdoor scenes
- Trophy room and unused classrooms for secret meetings
- Hospital Wing for injury aftermath scenes
