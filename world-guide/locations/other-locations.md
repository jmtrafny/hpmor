## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Godric's Hollow is Potter murder site
- St. Mungo's automatically notifies Aurors of suspicious injuries
- Mary's Place exists as private meeting venue
- Platform 9¾ standard access to Hogwarts Express
- Graveyard used for Voldemort's plans
- International magical communities exist but didn't intervene in First War
- Harry raised in Oxford, not at Dursleys

**What's Open to Interpretation** [AMBIGUOUS]:
- Layout and details of most locations
- Exact location of Mary's Place
- Which graveyard Voldemort planned to use
- Details of Malfoy Manor
- Whether Hogsmeade exists in HPMOR
- International magical school details
- What "void between the stars" means

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't put Harry at Dursley house - he was raised by Verres family
- Don't forget St. Mungo's auto-reports suspicious injuries
- Don't assume Hogsmeade exists - never mentioned in HPMOR
- Don't ignore that international communities chose not to intervene in war
- Don't forget Godric's Hollow significance to Harry's origin

**Useful for Stories**:
- Godric's Hollow for Harry exploring his past
- St. Mungo's for medical treatment and Auror notification
- Mary's Place for secret meetings and plot development
- Platform 9¾ for beginning-of-year and end-of-year scenes
- Malfoy Manor for Draco's family dynamics
- International locations for expanding HPMOR universe
- Oxford for Harry's childhood/family flashbacks
