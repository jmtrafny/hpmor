# Diagon Alley

## Overview

Diagon Alley is magical Britain's primary shopping district, featuring "the twisting main street" with shops for magical supplies, Gringotts Bank, and access via the Leaky Cauldron [Ch. 3, 6]. Harry and McGonagall spend most of Chapter 6 shopping here for Hogwarts supplies.

## Cultural Atmosphere [Ch. 3, 6]

- Magical protections on merchandise standard
- Shopkeepers use elaborate politeness with wealthy customers

## Knockturn Alley [Ch. 7, 108]

**Relationship to Diagon Alley**: Connected but separate (darker area)

**Reputation**:
- "Blood purism as argued by drunks in Knockturn Alley" [Ch. 108] - Voldemort's characterization
- Implies lower-class, disreputable area
- Dark magic connections suggested
- Not explored in HPMOR narrative

## Security and Magic

### Shop Protections [Ch. 6]

- "Slight grey glows" protecting displayed merchandise
- Salespeople monitor customers
- Anti-theft wards presumably standard

### Public Safety

- Aurors patrol or respond to incidents [IMPLIED]
- Ministry presence to maintain order
- Relatively safe for shopping despite war's recent end

## HPMOR vs Canon Differences

**Retained from Canon**:
- Gringotts as goblin-run bank with high security
- Leaky Cauldron access point
- Main shopping street with standard shops (Ollivanders, Flourish and Blotts, Madam Malkin's)
- Potter family vault with substantial gold
- Knockturn Alley as darker connected area

**HPMOR Specific Details**:
- Harry's "claim this territory in the name of Science" moment [Ch. 6]
- Detailed Emergency Healing Pack description [Ch. 6]
- Emphasis on war's psychological impact on shopkeepers [Ch. 6]
- Goblin counterfeit warfare explicitly stated [Ch. 15]
- Trunk shop's elaborate decor described [Ch. 6]

**Tone Difference**:
- HPMOR emphasizes post-war trauma more than canon
- More detailed economics (prices, vault contents)
- Harry's scientific mindset applied to magical items (mokeskin pouch experiments)

## Key Scenes

- **Ch. 3**: Harry and McGonagall enter via Leaky Cauldron; Harry recognized by war veterans; arrive at Gringotts
- **Ch. 4**: Visit to Potter vault reveals substantial inheritance
- **Ch. 6**: Extended shopping trip; mokeskin pouch experiments; Emergency Healing Pack discussion; salesgirl incident about war deaths
- **Ch. 51**: Quirrell mentions Gringotts security when discussing Azkaban

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

**What's Established**:
- Diagon Alley is main wizarding shopping district accessed via Leaky Cauldron
- Gringotts vaults have been successfully robbed despite high security
- War trauma affects shopkeepers and customers (salesgirl incident)
- Harry's Potter vault contains substantial gold (specific amount not stated)
- Emergency Healing Pack costs 5 Galleons
- Mokeskin pouches have Retrieval Charms with natural language understanding
- Goblin nation permanently at war with counterfeiters

**What's Open to Interpretation** [AMBIGUOUS]:
- Exact number and names of shops beyond those mentioned
- Full layout of Diagon Alley street system
- What "unfortunate incident at Potions shop" entailed [Ch. 6]
- How much gold Harry actually has in vault
- Details of Knockturn Alley beyond reputation

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- Don't forget war's psychological impact on magical Britain
- Don't make Gringotts impenetrable - text says vaults have been robbed
- Don't ignore that goblins will send army after counterfeiters
- Don't forget this is ten years post-war, not immediately after
- Don't make Diagon Alley frivolous - serious undertones present

**Useful for Stories**:
- Shopping scenes for character bonding/conflict
- Gringotts as heist location (has been robbed before)
- War trauma as character background motivation
- Harry's vault as financial resource for plots
- Diagon Alley as public space where news spreads
- Goblin relations as political subplot
