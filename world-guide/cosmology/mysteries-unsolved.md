# Mysteries Unsolved - What HPMOR Deliberately Doesn't Answer

## Overview

HPMOR is unusual among fanfiction in that it deliberately leaves many cosmological and magical questions **unanswered**. This isn't lazy writing—it's intentional design. Eliezer Yudkowsky chose to leave these mysteries open for several reasons: maintaining story focus, avoiding unnecessary worldbuilding, preserving sense of wonder, and leaving creative space for readers and other fanfiction writers. This file catalogs what's explicitly left ambiguous so writers know what they can freely interpret.

## Purpose of This Document

**For Fanfiction Writers**: These are **open territories**. You can create your own answers to these questions without contradicting HPMOR canon. This is where your creativity has free reign.

**For Readers**: Understanding what's deliberately unanswered helps you appreciate the story's focus on what IS answered (rationality, relationships, death as enemy, etc.).

    - Echoes/impressions left by the dead?
    - Actual souls/consciousness in limited form?
    - Magical constructs created by dying wizard?

## Magical Creatures [AMBIGUOUS]

### Origin of Magical Creatures

16. **Why do magical creatures follow Rowling's rules?** [AMBIGUOUS]
    - Why do dragons exist in HPMOR's universe?

    - Harry wants to understand magic scientifically
    - Partial Transfiguration proves understanding physics helps
    - But can they be truly unified into single framework?
    - Or are they fundamentally separate systems?
    - **Evidence given**: Scientific thinking helps use magic better. Full unification not achieved in story.

21. **What is "magic" as a substance or energy?** [AMBIGUOUS]
    - Is there magical energy that powers spells?
    - Or does Source of Magic do all the work?

### Is He Really Gone?

25. **Did Harry truly defeat Voldemort permanently?** [IMPLIED BUT NOT CERTAIN]
    - Story implies yes (Voldemort killed in final confrontation)
    - But 100+ Horcruxes exist in inaccessible locations [Ch. 108]
    - Voldemort Obliviated himself so he can't retrieve them
    - Could he eventually recover one?

## Why These Questions Are Left Unanswered

### Story Design Reasons [Meta]

27. **Eliezer's Philosophy on Unanswered Questions**
    - Story focuses on: rationality, relationships, death as enemy, Harry's growth
    - Cosmology is background, not focus
    - Answering everything would:
      - Distract from core themes
      - Remove sense of wonder/mystery
      - Constrain future stories (including others' fanfiction)
      - Require extensive worldbuilding not relevant to plot
    - Leaving questions open:
      - Maintains sense of vast, mysterious universe
      - Invites reader/writer engagement
      - Allows focus on what matters to Harry's story
      - Respects that reality has unsolved mysteries

## Implications for Fanfiction Writers

### What This Means For You

**Freedom**: All questions in this document are **open territory**. You can answer them however you want without contradicting HPMOR canon.

**Responsibility**: Just because you CAN answer these doesn't mean you SHOULD. Consider:
- Does answering this question serve your story?
- Or would leaving it mysterious be more effective?
- Will your answer constrain future stories you might write?

**Creativity**: These mysteries are gifts to writers. Use them:
- "What if Atlantis was actually..." → Full story premise
- "Harry investigates the afterlife" → Character arc
- "Discovery of Source of Magic's location" → Plot driver
- "New magical creature emerges" → Worldbuilding opportunity

### Which Mysteries Matter Most

**Core to HPMOR Universe**:
- Atlantis and Source of Magic (shapes everything)
- Soul mechanics and afterlife (central to death theme)
- Dementor origin (tied to death as enemy)

**Interesting but Secondary**:
- Magical creature origins
- Lost historical knowledge
- Specific spell mechanisms

**Mostly Flavor**:
- Why specific creatures exist
- Detailed Atlantean culture
- Minute magical mechanics

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Answering questions HPMOR deliberately left open**: Don't claim "HPMOR says X" when it doesn't.
2. **Creating answers that contradict established facts**: Your Atlantis theory must fit with "created Source of Magic, enforces Interdict, used DNA markers."
3. **Over-explaining everything**: Mystery is valuable. Don't turn HPMOR into encyclopedia.
4. **Ignoring the implications**: If you say "there's an afterlife," Harry's quest against death means something different.
5. **Forgetting the scientific method**: If Harry investigates these mysteries, he'd do so scientifically.
