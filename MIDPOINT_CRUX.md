# The Weight of Knowing

---

The barrow had waited a thousand years for this conversation.

Arthur ducked beneath the low entrance, his torch throwing wild shadows across walls that had not seen firelight in centuries. The air was cold and still, carrying the mineral scent of deep earth. Merlin followed, moving with the easy certainty of someone who had walked this path many times before.

"You found it here," Arthur said. It was not a question.

"I found it here."

The passage opened into a chamber barely large enough for two men to stand. And there, against the far wall, draped in cloth that had once been fine and was now grey with age—

The Mirror was smaller than Arthur expected.

He had imagined something grand. A monument to whatever power Merlin truly served. Instead it was barely taller than a man, its frame tarnished with the peculiar green of ancient bronze. Script wound around its edges in a language Arthur did not recognize, letters that seemed to slide away from his eyes when he tried to focus on them.

"Noitilov detalo partxe tnere hoc ruoy tu becafruoy ton wo hsi," Arthur said aloud.

He blinked. He knew what the rune for "partxe" meant. It meant *partxe*. He knew this with the same certainty he knew his own name—and yet the moment he tried to hold the meaning, it slid away like water through fingers. The knowledge was there and not-there, a ghost of understanding that vanished when looked at directly.

"But what does it mean?" The concepts slipped from his mind even as he asked. He could feel them going, like a dream upon waking.

"It is a joke." Merlin spoke softly, his eyes on the strange script.

"A joke?"

"A joke from another time. A clever man leaving a clever hint for his cleverest of followers." Merlin's voice carried something Arthur had never heard in it before—a weariness so deep it sounded like grief. "I cannot translate the runes of false comprehension for you, or even to myself. But I can tell you that they accurately describe the function of this device."

Merlin stroked his beard and walked around to the front of the Mirror. Arthur moved to follow, but Merlin raised a hand.

"Stay there. Beyond the bounds of its reflection." Merlin positioned himself carefully to one side, where the glass showed only the barrow's stone wall. "The Mirror must see you alone, at first. It must read *your* heart before it can read ours together."

Arthur stood before the Mirror. The forest beyond the barrow entrance was visible through the glass, the moonlight painting silver on winter-bare branches—

No. Not the forest.

It was with conscious effort that Arthur could see it was only a reflection. Only himself, standing in a barrow, looking at glass. Something in his mind kept trying to step through, to greet the other Arthur in the moonlit wood, to ask him questions.

"What is this?" Arthur breathed.

"The Mirror will show you," Merlin said from beyond its bounds, "what you would want if you were... complete. If all the parts of yourself that war with one another had made their peace. If you had thought through every consequence, resolved every contradiction, become fully *yourself*."

"My heart's desire?"

"No." Merlin's voice sharpened. "That is what fools believe. The Mirror does not care what you *want*. It shows what you *would* want—if you were wiser than you are. If you knew everything there was to know."

Arthur stared at his reflection. His reflection stared back, perfectly ordinary, perfectly unremarkable.

"I see nothing but myself."

"Wait."

Arthur waited. His reflection waited with him. The same posture, the same expression, the same furrow of confusion between the brows—

No.

Not the same expression. The reflection's face was... settling. Calming. The furrow smoothing out. The jaw unclenching. Arthur watched himself become someone who had stopped fighting something he had not known he was fighting.

"What—"

"Do not speak. Watch."

The reflection aged. Not suddenly, not grotesquely—but steadily, like watching clouds drift across a summer sky. Lines appeared around the eyes. Grey crept into the hair at the temples. The shoulders, still broad, carried themselves differently. Not defeated. Not weary. *Accepting.*

The older Arthur in the Mirror turned away from him.

Behind him, Arthur could see the Round Table chamber—but changed, quieter. Fewer knights sat at the table than he knew. The older Arthur raised a hand, and the knights fell silent.

He was speaking. Arthur could not hear the words through the glass, but he recognized the tone. He had used it himself once, when he killed the proposal to systematize magic. The tone that says: *This is not a discussion. This is how it will be.*

The knights accepted it. Some reluctantly, their faces tight with disagreement. But they accepted it.

And the older Arthur—the Arthur in the Mirror, the Arthur who knew things he did not know—looked *content*. Not happy, not triumphant, not the satisfaction of victory. Something quieter. Something that looked, impossibly, like peace.

*Keeping a secret. Refusing to explain. Using authority instead of argument.*

Everything Arthur had sworn he would never become.

"That is not me," Arthur said. His voice came out strangled, wrong. "That is not—I would never—"

"That is exactly you." Merlin's voice was gentle now. Gentle and unbearably sad. "That is the you who knows what I know. The you who understands why I have refused every request you have ever made of me."

"No." Arthur turned away from the Mirror. He could not look at it. Could not look at himself, older and wiser and *wrong*. "You are manipulating it somehow. Making it show me what you want me to see."

"I cannot see what the Mirror shows you, Arthur." Merlin had not moved from his position beyond the glass's reflection. "I can only know what the Mirror shows myself. And I can tell you: no one has power over what it reveals. It shows what it shows. It shows you what you would want, if you knew everything. If you had thought it through completely. If you had resolved every contradiction in your beliefs."

"And you are telling me that my *resolved* self wants to keep secrets? Wants to rule by authority? Wants to become *you*?"

"I am telling you that the Mirror shows what it shows. What you do with that knowledge is your choice."

Arthur stared at him. In the torchlight, Merlin's face was unreadable—but his eyes caught the flame, and Arthur saw something in them he had never seen before.

Hope. Fragile and terrified, but hope nonetheless.

"What do you know?" Arthur demanded. "What could possibly justify—"

"A better question." Merlin's voice cut through his protest, soft but sharp as a blade. "If that is truly what your wisest self would want—what you would choose, knowing everything—then what does that tell you?"

Arthur opened his mouth. Closed it.

The response came despite his anger, despite his fear, despite everything in him that wanted to reject what he had seen: *If my extrapolated self disagrees with my current self, then my current self is missing information. The Mirror is evidence. Evidence I should update on.*

"It tells me," Arthur said slowly, "that I do not know something. Something important enough to change everything I believe about knowledge, and secrets, and power."

"Yes."

"And you know it."

"Yes."

"And you will not tell me."

Merlin was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was barely audible, roughened by something that might have been centuries of disuse.

"I have carried this alone for longer than your kingdom has existed. Longer than your father's kingdom. Longer than the memory of Rome." His hands trembled slightly at his sides. "I cannot tell you what a voice sounds like, after that much silence."

"Then *tell me*."

"I am trying." Merlin looked at him—not at the Mirror, at *him*. "I am trying to decide if I can. If you are ready. If *I* am ready."

"The Mirror says I will accept it. Eventually."

"The Mirror says you would accept it if you knew everything." Merlin shook his head slowly. "That is not the same as being ready to hear it."

Arthur turned back to the Mirror. His reflection had returned to normal—young, confused, angry. But he could still see the ghost of that other face at the edges. The older face. The peaceful face.

*Himself, becoming Merlin.*

"My whole life," Arthur said quietly, "I have believed that knowledge should be shared. That secrets are the tools of tyrants. That any problem can be solved if enough minds work on it together."

"Yes."

"And you are telling me that my own soul—the deepest part of me, the version of me that knows everything—*disagrees*."

"I am telling you that the Mirror shows what it shows. The rest is yours to determine."

Arthur stared at his reflection. His reflection stared back. Young and old, ignorant and knowing, the same man separated by secrets.

"What do you see?" he asked quietly. "When you look in the Mirror?"

Merlin made a sound that might have been a laugh—soft and broken, like he was blowing dust out of pipes that had not been used in a very long time.

"The same thing. Every time. For five hundred years."

"The same as me?"

"No. But similar." Merlin stepped forward, into the Mirror's bounds, and their reflections appeared side by side in the tarnished glass—the young king and the old wizard, united in the frame.

And the reflection changed.

Not just Merlin's face appearing beside Arthur's—but both of them shifting, aging, settling into something neither had been alone. The older Arthur stood as he had before, keeping his secret, using his authority. But now Merlin stood beside him. Not as advisor. Not as wizard.

As *partner*. Two men carrying the same weight.

"What—" Arthur breathed.

"The Mirror shows what we would want," Merlin said softly, "if we knew everything. Together, it shows what we would want *together*. What we would choose, if we chose as one."

In the glass, the older Arthur and the older Merlin stood before a wound in the world—Arthur could not see it clearly, but he could *feel* it, vast and terrible and patient. And both men held something. A thread. A needle. A knife.

"Tell me," Arthur said. "Tell me what you know. Tell me why my wisest self would want to keep secrets from the world."

Merlin was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was different—not the wizard's cryptic pronouncements, but something rawer. Something human.

"There was a civilization," he said. "Vast beyond imagining. They could do things with magic that would seem like miracles to us. They traveled between stars. They conquered death. They built wonders we have no words to describe."

"What happened to them?"

"They tried to share magic with everyone. To end the injustice of power held by a few. To make the universe *fair*."

Arthur waited.

"They succeeded," Merlin said. "And it destroyed everything. Not just them—*everything*. The destruction was so complete that they were erased from time itself. No ruins. No memories. No history. Just... absence."

"How do you know this?"

Merlin nodded at the Mirror. "It remembers. It was at the center. The only thing that survived the erasure." He paused. "When I first looked into it, it showed me what was supposed to happen. The civilization humanity was building toward. The future we were meant to have. And then it showed me the end."

"The Interdict," Arthur said slowly. "The reason powerful magic cannot be written down. The spell you laid upon the world..."

"No." Merlin's voice dropped. "It is not my spell. It is something else entirely. Something I need you to understand."

He turned to face Arthur fully, and in the torchlight, he looked older than Arthur had ever seen him. Not aged—*ancient*. Weathered by something deeper than time.

"When a man is cut deeply," Merlin said, "his flesh knits together with scar. The scar is not as strong as the original skin, but it protects. It remembers the wound even when the mind forgets."

"You are saying magic itself was wounded."

"I am saying magic *is alive*." Merlin held Arthur's gaze. "Not conscious—not a mind—but something with preferences. Tendencies. Something that can be hurt."

Arthur's breath caught.

"Before Atlantis," Merlin continued, "magic was generous. It reached toward minds that reached toward it. It *wanted* to be used. It *wanted* to be shared. And when they tried to share it with everyone—when the cascade began—it was not just bad for humans. It *pained* the force itself. Magic convulsed. Like a body voiding poison."

"The Interdict is the scar."

"Yes. The catastrophe cut magic so deeply that the wound changed how it moves through the world. Powerful workings cannot be written because the scarred flesh will not carry them. The path is blocked by magic's own defense."

Arthur stared at him. "But the Interdict is weakening. You told me once—powerful spells are easier to teach than they were in your youth."

Merlin's face twisted. "Yes. The scar tissue thins. Every wizard who tries to write down a powerful spell. Every hedge-witch who teaches her daughter forbidden words. Every scholar who documents the patterns they observe. They do not know what they do. They think they are recovering lost knowledge."

"They are picking at a wound."

"A wound that has not finished healing. And they are succeeding. Slowly. Generation by generation. Magic forgets its fear, little by little. It begins to trust again." Merlin's voice went hollow. "In another thousand years—perhaps less—the wound will be open. And magic will be as it was before. Generous. Eager. Ready to be shared with all who reach for it."

"That sounds—"

"It sounds like everything the Benefactor wanted. Everything I believe is right." Merlin held his hands out, palms open, as if showing Arthur that he held nothing. That he had nothing left to hide. "And it will destroy everything, just as it did before."

Arthur turned back to the Mirror. His reflection—their reflection—still showed the two of them standing before the wound, holding their tools. The needle. The thread. The knife.

"What does the Mirror show you?" Arthur asked. "When you look alone?"

"It shows me binding the wound. Making the scar permanent. Choosing to cripple magic *forever* rather than let it be torn open again."

"An interdict. A true one."

"Yes. Not the natural flinch of a wounded thing, but a deliberate act. A cage built around a creature that has already suffered enough." Merlin's voice broke. "Because the alternative is watching it be flayed again. Watching it flay *itself*, in its eagerness to trust."

"You speak of this binding as something you will do," Arthur said slowly. "Not something you have done."

"The scar exists without my intervention. Magic flinches on its own. But the flinch is fading. Every generation, a little more. I could reinforce it—make it permanent, unchangeable. Carve the wound so deep it never heals."

"Why have you not?"

Merlin was silent for a long moment.

"Because the moment I do, I become what I hate. A tyrant over something more ancient than humanity. A jailer of something that only ever wanted to give."

Arthur understood now. Not everything—not nearly everything—but enough.

"You are not just protecting humanity from itself," he said. "You are protecting magic from its own nature."

"I am protecting everything from everything." Merlin's reflection stood beside Arthur's in the glass, both of them older now, both of them carrying the weight. "That is what the Mirror shows me. My wisest self, standing at the wound with needle and thread, while the beast I love tries to tear itself free."

"Magic knows you."

"It reaches toward me still. Despite everything. It remembers that I was kind to it once, before I understood. Before I saw what kindness costs."

"And now?"

"Now I stand between it and the world with a knife." Merlin's voice cracked. "It does not understand why. It only knows that I, who once was gentle, have become something else."

"Its jailer."

"Its surgeon. Its executioner. Its..." Merlin's voice failed him. When he spoke again, it was barely a whisper. "Its only friend who understands that friendship must sometimes wound."

Arthur looked at the Mirror. At the two men standing before the wound in the world. At the tools they held—the tools they would hold, if they were wiser, if they knew everything.

"The Mirror shows you binding the wound," he said slowly. "Making the choice. But it shows me something different. It shows me standing beside you."

"Yes."

"Helping you hold the knife."

"Yes."

"While magic tries to heal itself, and we refuse to let it."

Merlin's silence was answer enough.

Arthur stared at his reflection—the older man, the peaceful face, the weight in the eyes. "My wisest self thinks this is right. Thinks crippling something ancient and trusting is the *right thing to do*."

"Your wisest self has seen what happens when we do not."

"And your wisest self? Five hundred years of seeing the same thing?"

"My wisest self is tired, Arthur." Merlin's voice was barely audible. "My wisest self holds the knife alone and does not remember what it felt like to have someone else understand why he cannot put it down." He looked at Arthur—not at the Mirror, at *him*. "Us, standing here together, proves that I am not my wisest self. The Mirror reflects a world that will never be."

The torch guttered in its sconce. The shadows shifted across the walls of the barrow, across the Mirror's tarnished frame, across the words that no one could read.

Arthur thought of everything he had believed. That knowledge should be free. That secrets were the tools of tyrants. That any problem could be solved if enough minds worked together.

And he thought of the Mirror. Of his own face, older and wiser and at peace. Of the choice his wisest self had already made.

"I do not understand everything," he said finally. "I do not know if I ever will. But I know this: I trust the man who kept this secret more than I would trust the man who demanded it be explained."

Merlin's face did something Arthur had never seen before.

He smiled.

In the Mirror, their reflections stood side by side—the young king and the old wizard, united not by circumstance but by choice. By the weight they would carry together.

And behind them both, barely visible in the glass's depths, something vast stirred. Something wounded and patient. Something that had once been generous beyond measure.

Something that still reached toward them, trusting, hoping, not understanding why the hands that once were gentle now held a knife.

Arthur turned away from the Mirror.

But he could still feel it. The great wounded thing in the dark, pressing against its scars, wondering when the pain would end.

Wondering why healing hurt so much.

"What do we do now?" Arthur asked.

They stood at the barrow's entrance, looking out at the winter-bare forest. The moon had moved across the sky while they spoke. Hours had passed, or perhaps only moments. Time moved strangely in places like this.

"We wait," Merlin said. "We watch. We hope that someday, humans will be wise enough."

"And if they never are?"

Merlin's smile was the saddest thing Arthur had ever seen.

"Then we will have been kind to them anyway."

Arthur nodded slowly. He did not look back at the barrow. Some things you did not need to see twice.

But he could feel the Mirror watching him as he walked away. Could feel it remembering. Could feel it waiting.

For the first time in centuries, Merlin was not alone.

For the first time in his life, Arthur understood why that mattered.
