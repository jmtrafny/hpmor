# The Weight of Knowing

## Chapter One: The Sword and the Stone

---

The throne was harder than the ground he used to sleep on.

Arthur shifted, trying to find a position that didn't make his back ache, and failed. Three months since the sword. Three months since the world had looked at a peasant boy and decided he was king. The stonemasons were already at work on a proper throne—cushioned, they promised, with velvet from the continent—but for now he sat on cold granite and listened to reports of the empire's collapse.

"Rome has fallen." Lord Ector's voice carried the particular weight of a man delivering news he did not fully believe. "The Visigoths sacked the city. The legions will not be returning."

*They were never returning*, Arthur thought. *The last legion left Britain forty years ago. Rome has been dying since before my father's father was born. This is simply the corpse finally admitting it.*

But he did not say this. He had learned, in his eleven years as a peasant, which thoughts to keep behind his teeth.

"And the plague?" Arthur asked instead.

"Spreading." This from Brother Marcus, who served as the closest thing Arthur had to a court physician. "The eastern ports are worst hit. We've closed the harbors at Londinium, but—" He spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness.

*Closing the harbors does nothing if the rats have already come ashore*, Arthur thought. *And if the plague spreads through breath, as I suspect, then every trader who arrived before the closure is already carrying it inland.*

He had tried to explain this, once. In his village, 
when old Marta had fallen sick and the elders had declared her house cursed. Arthur had pointed out that everyone who caught the sickness had been in contact with someone else who was sick—that it spread from person to person like fire from candle to candle. The village priest had beaten him for "questioning God's punishment."

A month later, half the village was dead. Including the priest.

Arthur had not felt satisfaction. Only a cold, terrible clarity: being right meant nothing if no one would listen.

"Your Majesty?" Lord Ector was watching him with that careful expression the nobles wore when they remembered their king was not yet twelve.

"Continue the harbor closures," Arthur said. The words tasted like ash. "And send healers to the eastern ports. Not to cure—" *because we have no cure, and pretending otherwise wastes resources* "—but to observe. I want to know how the sickness spreads. Which houses fall ill first. Whether it follows the roads or the rivers."

Brother Marcus frowned. "You wish to... study the plague, Your Majesty?"

"I wish to *understand* it. We cannot fight an enemy we do not know."

The advisors exchanged glances. Arthur had seen those glances before—the silent communication of adults who believed children could not read faces. *He's strange*, their eyes said. *Unnatural. Perhaps the sword chose wrong.*

Let them think it. He had work to do.

"And the Saxons?" Arthur asked.

Lord Bedivere stepped forward—a younger man, barely twenty, but already scarred from a dozen border skirmishes. "Raiding parties along the eastern coast. Small groups so far. Testing our defenses."

"They're not testing. They're scouting." Arthur leaned forward. "The Saxons know Rome has fallen. They know we've lost our legions, our supply lines, our connection to the continent. They're mapping our weaknesses before the real invasion begins."

"With respect, Your Majesty—" Lord Bedivere began.

"You think I'm a child imagining monsters." Arthur held the knight's gaze. "Tell me, Lord Bedivere: if you were a Saxon war-chief, and you learned that the greatest empire in history had just collapsed, leaving a wealthy island defended by squabbling lords with no central command—would you wait?"

Bedivere's jaw tightened. But he was honest, at least. "No, Your Majesty. I would not."

"Then we have perhaps a year. Maybe two, if we're fortunate and their harvest is good." Arthur stood, ignoring the ache in his legs from the unforgiving throne. "I want a census of every fighting man in every holding that acknowledges the crown. I want an accounting of our grain stores, our forges, our horses. I want maps of every road, every river crossing, every defensible position between here and the coast."

"Your Majesty," Ector said carefully, "these are the preparations of a man expecting war."

"War is coming whether we expect it or not. I would rather be prepared than surprised."

He descended the steps from the throne—five stairs, each one carved with symbols of kingdoms that no longer existed. At the base, half-hidden in the shadows of a pillar, stood Merlin.

The old wizard had not moved throughout the entire council. Had not spoken. Had barely seemed to breathe. He simply watched, as he always watched, with those dark eyes that saw everything and offered nothing.

Arthur felt the familiar surge of frustration. Three months, and Merlin had done nothing. Cast no spells. Healed no wounds. Offered no counsel that couldn't have come from any village elder with a talent for obvious advice. The legendary wizard of Britain, and he was about as useful as a decorative tapestry.

*When I find a competent healer*, Arthur thought, not for the first time, *I will thank Merlin for his service and send him on his way. Whatever magic he once had, it is clear he has none left.*

"You disagree with something, wizard?" Arthur kept his voice flat. "You've stood there for two hours without speaking. Surely you have an opinion."

Merlin's expression didn't change. "You are preparing for the wrong war, Your Majesty."

"The Saxons—"

"Will come. Yes. And you will fight them, and perhaps you will win." Merlin's voice was soft, almost tired. "But the Saxons are not the threat that matters."

"Then what is?"

For a long moment, Merlin simply looked at him. Not at a king—not even at a child. At something else entirely. Something he seemed to be measuring against a standard Arthur couldn't see.

"When you are ready to hear the answer," Merlin said, "you will not need to ask the question."

He turned and walked away, his staff clicking against the stone floor.

Arthur watched him go, irritation curdling in his chest. *Cryptic nonsense. Riddles and vagaries dressed up as wisdom.* He had known men like Merlin in the village—old fools who mistook obscurity for profundity, who used mystery to hide their ignorance.

*And yet.*

The sword had come to him in a pillar of light. The stone had opened at his touch like a flower greeting the sun. Whatever Arthur believed about magic, whatever doubts he harbored about the old wizard's usefulness, he could not deny that *something* had chosen him. Something beyond the normal workings of the world.

*Chosen you for what?* a voice whispered in his mind. *To die fighting Saxons? To watch a plague hollow out your kingdom? To sit on a cold throne and make decisions no one will follow?*

Arthur shook his head, banishing the thought. There was work to do. There was always work to do.

He would understand magic eventually. He would understand Merlin. He would understand everything, given enough time and enough data.

He was eleven years old, and he was going to save Britain through the systematic application of reason.

In the shadows of the pillar, unseen, Merlin had paused to look back.

*So young*, the wizard thought. *So certain. So ready to believe that all problems yield to analysis, that all mysteries surrender to investigation, that the universe plays fair if you only ask the right questions.*

*I was like that once. Before I learned the cost.*

He watched Arthur stride out of the throne room, already calling for maps and messengers.

*You will hate me*, Merlin thought. *Before this is over, you will hate me more than you have ever hated anyone. And I will let you. Because the alternative is letting you become what I was. And the world cannot afford another idealist with power.*

The wizard turned away and walked into the darkness.

The conversation that would change everything was still years away.

But it was coming.
