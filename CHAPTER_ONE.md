# The Weight of Knowing

## Chapter One: The Sword and the Stone

---

The throne was harder than the ground he used to sleep on.

Arthur shifted, trying to find a position that didn't make his back ache, and failed. Three months since the sword. Three months since the world had looked at a peasant boy and decided he was king. The stonemasons were already at work on a proper throne—cushioned, they promised, with velvet from the continent—but for now he sat on cold granite and listened to reports of the empire's collapse.

"Rome has fallen." Lord Ector's voice carried the particular weight of a man delivering news he did not fully believe. "The Visigoths sacked the city. The legions will not be returning."

Arthur kept his face still. He had heard the traders talking, back in the village—the ones who came through twice a year with salt and iron tools. They spoke of empty forts along Hadrian's Wall, of Roman roads slowly being reclaimed by forest, of letters sent to the continent that never received replies. His father—his foster father, he reminded himself, the man who had raised him—had served in a Roman auxiliary unit forty years ago. "The legions were already ghosts when I was young," he'd told Arthur once, deep in his cups. "We just hadn't admitted it yet."

But he did not say this. He had learned, in his eleven years as a peasant, which thoughts to keep behind his teeth.

"And the plague?" Arthur asked instead.

"Spreading." This from Brother Marcus, who served as the closest thing the court had to a physician—though his training was more prayer than poultice. "The eastern ports are worst hit. We've closed the harbors at Londinium, but—" He spread his hands in a gesture of helplessness.

*Closing the harbors does nothing if the sickness has already come ashore*, Arthur thought. He remembered old Marta, back in the village. How she had fallen ill three days after her son returned from the eastern markets, blood in his stool and fever in his eyes. How the elders had declared her house cursed by evil spirits. Arthur had pointed out that everyone who caught the sickness had touched someone else who was sick—had cleaned their soiled linens or wiped the blood from their lips. It spread through contact, through the mingling of fluids, like poison passed hand to hand.

The village priest had beaten him for "questioning God's punishment."

A month later, half the village was dead. Including the priest.

Arthur had not felt satisfaction. Only a cold, terrible clarity: being right meant nothing if no one would listen.

"Continue the harbor closures," Arthur said. The words tasted like ash—he suspected the closures were useless, the sickness already spreading inland through a hundred vectors he couldn't see. "And send observers to the eastern ports. Not healers—we have no cure, and pretending otherwise wastes lives. I want men who can watch and record. Which houses fall ill first. Whether it follows the roads or the rivers. Whether those who survive can catch it again."

Brother Marcus frowned. "You wish to... study the plague, Your Majesty? While people are dying?"

"People will die whether we study it or not. But if we learn how it moves, we might save the next village. And the one after that."

The advisors exchanged glances. Arthur had seen those glances before—the silent communication of adults who believed children could not read faces. *He's strange*, their eyes said. *Unnatural. Perhaps the sword chose wrong.*

Let them think it. He had work to do.

"And the Saxons?" Arthur asked.

Lord Bedivere stepped forward—a younger man, barely twenty, but already scarred from a dozen border skirmishes. "Raiding parties along the eastern coast. Small groups so far. Testing our defenses."

"They're not testing. They're scouting."

Bedivere's jaw tightened. "With respect, Your Majesty, I have fought these raiders for three years. They come for plunder—grain, cattle, women. They test our response times, probe for weak points in our coastal watches. It is the same pattern every spring."

"And every spring, have the raids grown larger or smaller?"

A pause. "Larger, Your Majesty. But that is simply—"

"More men. Better coordination. Longer expeditions." Arthur leaned forward. "Lord Bedivere, when a fox circles a henhouse, does it strike immediately? Or does it learn the farmer's routines first? When does he sleep? When does he check the coop? Where are the gaps in the fence?"

"Saxons are not foxes, Your Majesty. They are warriors."

"Warriors led by chiefs who want to *win*. The Saxons know Rome has fallen—that news has reached every shore in the known world by now. They know we've lost our legions, our supply lines, our connection to the continent. If you were a Saxon war-chief, and you learned that the greatest empire in history had just collapsed, leaving a wealthy island defended by squabbling lords with no central command—would you raid for cattle? Or would you begin planning something larger?"

Bedivere was silent for a long moment. His scars stood out white against his weathered face.

"I would send scouts," he said finally. "I would learn the land. I would count the fighting men and map the fortifications." His voice roughened. "And then I would come with every warrior I could muster, because an opportunity like this comes once in a hundred generations."

"Then we have perhaps a year. Maybe two, if we're fortunate and their harvest is good." Arthur stood, ignoring the ache in his legs from the unforgiving throne. "I want a census of every fighting man in every holding that acknowledges the crown. I want an accounting of our grain stores, our forges, our horses. I want maps of every road, every river crossing, every defensible position between here and the coast."

"Your Majesty," Ector said carefully, "these are the preparations of a man expecting war."

"War is coming whether we expect it or not. I would rather be prepared than surprised."

He descended the steps from the throne—five stairs, each one carved with symbols of kingdoms that no longer existed. At the base, half-hidden in the shadows of a pillar, stood Merlin.

The old man had not moved throughout the entire council. Had not spoken. Had barely seemed to breathe. He simply watched, as he always watched, with those dark eyes that saw everything and offered nothing.

Arthur felt the familiar surge of frustration. Three months since the sword, and Merlin had done nothing. Cast no spells—if he even could. Healed no wounds. Offered no counsel that couldn't have come from any village elder with a talent for obvious advice. The legendary wizard of Britain, advisor to the old king, and he was about as useful as a decorative tapestry.

*Charlatan*, Arthur thought. He had known men like Merlin in the village—"cunning folk" who sold charms against evil spirits and potions for fertility, who maintained their mystique through cryptic pronouncements and convenient excuses. *The spell didn't work because you didn't believe hard enough. The charm failed because you angered the spirits.* Always an explanation that blamed the victim.

But Merlin was more dangerous than a village hedge-witch. Merlin had been close to the old king. Merlin had *known* about the sword in the stone—had announced its existence to the court, had proclaimed that whoever drew it would be the true king of Britain. And when a peasant boy had pulled it free...

*Convenient*, Arthur thought. *Very convenient that a wizard proclaims a test, and the test produces a king with no allies, no family, no claim except the wizard's own pronouncement. A boy who should be grateful. A boy who should listen to his elders.*

He had heard stories, in the chaos after Rome's fall. Cunning men who rose up in the barbarian lands, who used tricks and superstition to make themselves indispensable to warrior chiefs. Men who understood that real power came not from swinging a sword but from whispering in the ear of the man who did.

Arthur looked at Merlin and saw a man who had placed a sword in a stone with the help of clever stonemasons. Who had waited for the right moment to "discover" an ancient prophecy. Who had engineered a succession crisis to make himself kingmaker.

*I will find out how you did it*, Arthur promised silently. *And when I do, I will thank you for your service and send you somewhere far from court. Somewhere you cannot whisper in any more ears.*

"You disagree with something, wizard?" Arthur kept his voice flat. "You've stood there for two hours without speaking. Surely you have an opinion."

Merlin's expression didn't change. "You have capable advisors, Your Majesty. They do not need my counsel."

*Because you have none to give. Because everything you know is smoke and misdirection.*

"Then why do you attend these councils at all?"

"Because you have not yet dismissed me."

There was no insolence in the words. No challenge. Just a simple statement of fact, delivered with the patience of a man who had long since stopped caring what others thought of him.

Arthur studied the old man's face, looking for the tell—the flicker of calculation, the hidden smirk of a con artist watching his mark take the bait. He found nothing. Just weariness, and something else he couldn't name.

"You may go," Arthur said.

Merlin inclined his head and turned away, his walking staff clicking against the stone floor.

Arthur watched him disappear into the shadows of the corridor. *Cryptic nonsense. Riddles and vagaries dressed up as wisdom.* The sooner he found a real physician—someone trained in the healing arts of Rome or Constantinople, someone who understood the body as mechanism rather than mystery—the sooner he could dispense with Merlin entirely.

*And yet.*

The sword had come to him in a pillar of light. The stone had opened at his touch like a flower greeting the sun. Arthur had examined that stone afterward—had run his hands over every seam, had questioned the masons who supposedly could not explain how it was made. He had found no hidden mechanism. No clever trick. Just solid rock that had somehow yielded to him and him alone.

*Chosen you for what?* a voice whispered in his mind. *To die fighting Saxons? To watch a plague hollow out your kingdom? To sit on a cold throne and make decisions with authority granted by a rock and a hundred centimeters of steel?*

Arthur shook his head, banishing the thought. There was work to do. There was always work to do.

The work had been different as a peasant—harder on the body, simpler in the mind. Wake before dawn. Tend the animals. Work the fields. Eat what you could. Sleep when the light failed. His muscles had ached every night, but his thoughts had been his own.

Kingship was harder in a different way. He had expected luxury when he first arrived at court—the soft beds and rich foods the village storytellers described. And he could have had them, if he was willing to let his advisors run roughshod over him and his lands. He could sit back, grow fat on candied fruits, and let the lords do as they pleased while Britain crumbled. That was what they expected. What they wanted. A boy-king who would sign what they put in front of him and stay out of the way.

These last three months had shown them otherwise.

Arthur strode out of the throne room, already composing the letters he would need to send. Census demands. Supply requisitions. Requests for maps and scouts. A hundred small preparations for a war that might be a year away or might already be beginning.

Behind him, in the shadows of the pillar, Merlin had paused.

The old wizard stood motionless for a long moment, watching the space where Arthur had been. His face betrayed nothing. His thoughts remained his own.

Then he turned and walked into the darkness, his staff clicking a slow rhythm against the stone.
